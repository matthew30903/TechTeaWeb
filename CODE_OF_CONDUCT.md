# Code of Conduct

If you would like to participate in TechTea and our mission to promote Digital Freedom, Privacy, and Personal Digital Sovereignty then you will need to agree to a simple code of conduct while participating with our community. It is really simple:

1. Be excellent to each other.

That is it really.

## Clarification

We do not think it should be necessary to spell out what constitutes being a good person, but the internet has shown that time and time again people will go out of there way to make life worse for their fellow humans. Therefor we present the above rule for our community. Unlike some codes of conduct that are exclusionary or otherwise not fit for purpose we believe that this should be sufficient. 

To be excellent to one another is to show mutual respect of each other's differences be that cultural, physical, or philosophical. We do not care what you look like, what your gender is, what you do with other consenting adults, or who you choose to worship and not worship. We are united by a common mission to help improve the lives of our fellow humans via technology, we should not fight over small differences in lifestyle or opinion in light of that.

Please do not make things more complicated than they need to be. We are all friends here, lets keep it simple.
