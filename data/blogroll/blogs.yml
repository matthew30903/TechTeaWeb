- Name: 'Starbreaker'
  Description: Starbreaker's personal blog covers a little of everything from the personal web to politics. He also writes fiction, but I have yet to read any. He is one of the first blogs I found when discovering the personal/IndieWeb. He rarely holds anything back so I would say don't read if you are thin skinned or on a work computer.

  Description: Chris Aldrich's website is interesting. It is an online commonplace book. He links to a lot, logs a little bit of everything, and is all around a strange place online. I don't read it much, but I find the idea very interesting.

- Name: "Devastatia"
  Description: Devastatia's website is NSFW in a self-aware edgy kind of way and I see it as a bit of a parody of everything the corporate hates. If you are uncomfortable with images of scantly clad women and sexual language I'd say you might not want to read her stuff. She talks a lot about the web as a whole, some mild politics, and philosophy. There is a lot of insight on her site if you look past the sexual humor.
