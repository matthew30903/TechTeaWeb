- Name: "Devastatia"
  Description: Devastatia's website is NSFW in a self-aware edgy kind of way and I see it as a bit of a parody of everything the corporate hates. If you are uncomfortable with images of scantly clad women and sexual language I'd say you might not want to read her stuff. She talks a lot about the web as a whole, some mild politics, and philosophy. There is a lot of insight on her site if you look past the sexual humor.
