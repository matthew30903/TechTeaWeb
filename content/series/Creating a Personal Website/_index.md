This is a series of posts covering owning a personal website. Hopefully you will find the information here useful.

The information in these articles is geared towards hobby sites, blogs, and other non-commercial web development. We want to break free from the corporate web that we have all gotten to know and love over the years in favor of a more personal web that values human connection and creates real value for ourselves others. Take a look at the IndieWeb [Principles](https://indieweb.org/principles) and see if it resonates with you.

If you want make a website that specializes in gaining clicks and ad revenue I suggest you look elsewhere.
