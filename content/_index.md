Welcome to TechTea, my humble slice of the internet. This is the personal website of [Matthew Lamont](/authors/matthew-lamont/). Here you will find my blog, projects, and anything else that interests me.

My blog consists of articles, these are longer form content focused on [FOSS Software](/articles/2021/what-is-free-and-open-source-software-foss/), Digital Freedom and Personal Digital Sovereignty, and Privacy. There is also a notes section, these are smaller titbits that I find interesting. Notes are still a new section to the site so there is not much there yet, but soon it will have a little bit of everything that doesn't fit nicely into an article.

I have been inspired by the IndieWeb to transition to this new format for TechTea. If you have any suggestions feel free to [contact me](mailto:hello@mattlamont.com). This site is ever changing and always expanding so feel free to subscribe to our RSS feeds: [Everything](/index.xml), [Articles](/articles/index.xml), and [Notes](/notes/index.xml).
