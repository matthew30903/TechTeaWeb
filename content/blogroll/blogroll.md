description: The web is a diverse place, there are many websites out there that are interesting, fun, and inspirational. Here are some that I read.

There are a lot of websites out there. Social media, big tech, and friends want to keep you from seeing all of that, but that isn't stopping the personal web from making web surfing fun again.

Here is a list of blogs and other interesting websites I've found. I don't read all of them often nor do I endorse what they say, but I have read at least a few things on their website and added them to my RSS feed. If you find one of these people do say or do something awful please let me know. Provide me with proof so I can remove them from this list.
