Tale Foundry tried using TikTok to see what book culture is like on the platform and was disappointed. 

For those who don't know, TikTok is a short form video sharing social media site. As someone who personally hates social media and prefers nuance I do have a biased against it so hearing an outside perspective is always useful. I wouldn't ever want to subject myself to all the invasive spying and addictive dark patterns that social media employs so I can only form my opinion based on second hand knowledge.

What Tale Foundry found was that the algorithm encouraged and fed a monoculture around romance fantasy novels, everything else would get buried behind that. The website is designed to be addicting and target negative biases by showing negative things.

On a positive note: Tale Foundry is happy to see people reading, even if it is mostly to create the look of someone who reads. 

My personal rant about the subject:

TikTok is the exact opposite of the kind of platform for creating discussion about books. Social media in general is less about discussion and more about short hot takes, TickTok and other short form platforms are even worse. They encourage endless scrolling, short hot takes, and an algorithmically generated monoculture. 

Online we need long form discussion and reviews that aren't designed to please malicious SEO gods. You will not find that on a busy commercial space like social media, it isn't as profitable. You might find it on personal websites, book discussion forums, and the like.
