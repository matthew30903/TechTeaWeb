Most of us know generative AI is some kind of techbro dystopian fantasy and scam. Unfortunately venture capital is still pumping money into it so we are a long way off from the days where we don't hear about it every day.

Rach Smith describes the "idea guy", a person who doesn't want to learn about how something works or how to implement it, but always has that *million dollar* idea. Usually these kinds of people can be shot down fairly easily or have to pay someone who actually knows what they are doing to design and build their half baked dream.

With generative AI though, they can have a computer guess how to make what they want. It is the ultimate dream for these idea guys, they don't need creativity, they don't need to learn anything, and most importantly they don't need to pay for someone competent to tell them their idea is stupid. Obviously this isn't working, as we have seen time and time again, but they still cling to the idea because tech bros and idea guys don't value anything more than *their* idea.

As Rach puts it:

> The suggestion that some word/picture guessing machine could actually do what I and other creators do is A. offensive and B. obviously just another fantastical idea. The implementation is what matters… and I’m not convinced the idea guys in Silicon Valley are going to figure it out.
