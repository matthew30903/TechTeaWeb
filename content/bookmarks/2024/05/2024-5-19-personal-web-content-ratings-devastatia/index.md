Devastatia shares the idea of content ratings on the personal web, including some [mascots created by Amber](https://www.mabsland.com/Adoption.html).

This is a great idea. Devastatia's own content could often be considered not safe for work so it is likely more relevant for her than my own site, but I had no idea that there was a meta tag for age rating. 

Devastatia has an online persona and website that many may find disagreeable, but no one is forcing anyone to read it. She has a lot of insight into the non-commercial and more personal web. She also has a lot of images of scantly clad women on most pages and uses a lot of sexual language that may be off putting to some. I recommend disabling images in your web browser when visiting her site if you don't want all the images. She has some good insight into the web on her website if you don't mind the jokes and (arguably) inflammatory nature of some of her posts.
