Sara Joy covers the amazing color-scheme property in CSS. Basically you don't need to create a dedicated dark and light mode if you don't want to, the color-scheme property can let the browser decide what colors to display on your website. It can do a lot of other things and this means you don't need JavaScript if you don't want to use it.

I might look into this further in the future. It is really cool what you can do with just HTML. You technically don't even need a CSS file.
