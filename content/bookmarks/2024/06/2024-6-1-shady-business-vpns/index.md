Eric Murphy goes over all the shady things VPN providers are doing. I was going to write a whole article on this myself, but his video covers most of my thoughts far better than I'd ever express them.

Unfortunately a lot of people are not aware of how bad the VPN industry is. There is a lot of misleading claims regarding privacy and security that make VPNs sound like a good idea, but usually you are better off without one. Some providers even own many of the VPN review sites to put their products on top of the lists.

A lot of VPN providers sell the idea of privacy with lies about public WiFi and how they don't track you, but the way a VPN works fundamentally gives the VPN provider an extreme amount of data on you.

If you see a VPN running sponsorship deals on YouTube or ads that tell you how dangerous the world is without one you should probably not use their product.

There are valid use cases for them, but most people in a non-authoritarian country will not need one. 

If you are torrenting a lot of legally obtained Linux ISOs or need to get around a geo-block go for a company that respects your privacy and allows for anonymous payments. Mullvad and ProtonVPN are both highly respected in the industry and privacy community. Still take them with a grain of salt and never assume that they make you private online, they just hide your traffic from your ISP.

This is a subject that is near to my heart as I know some people who are paranoid and got tricked by a VPN provider into thinking they need one. They think that VPNs will prevent people from hacking their computers and whenever something goes wrong on their system (usually internet related) they think someone is hacking them. In reality it is usually the VPN provider blocking some websites or just being slow. They don't believe me when I tell them because all the VPN review sites and YouTubers recommend them. I wish I was making this up.  

If I ever start talking positively about Nord or PIA (or anything owned by Kape Technologies for that matter) assume I'm dead and they have taken over my domain.

This is probably a subject I will visit again in the future, but for now Eric's video is a great overview if you were thinking of getting a VPN.
