Welcome to TechTea, my humble slice of the internet. Here you will find my blog, projects, and anything else that interests me.

I am a strong advocate for privacy, digital freedom, open source, and using technology to help out humanity as a whole. To the end I try to make some helpful and educational articles to help people break free from big tech, build a healthy relationship with technology, and own their own digital life.

I am firmly against the commercial web, the capitalistic brainwashing of hustle culture, broken intellectual property laws, and social media. These ideas reduce us from human to resources that are exploited, destroy our creativity, and isolate us. That is why everything I make on this site is free (see license below), I have no analytics or tracking on this website, and the only money I make off this site is from the donations of others.

## More Info

I'm slowly expanding this website with extra pages and interesting links inspired by other personal websites.

[Uses](/uses) - A list of the hardware and software that I use for my everyday life.  
[Reviews](/reviews) - My thoughts on all sorts of things. Lots of tea, but will also include places, hardware, software, and books eventually.  
[Articles](/articles) - My blog for longer form content. I've been writing off and on since 2013 so there is a lot there and some of questionable quality.  
[Notes](/notes) - Notes are for anything that doesn't require a full long form article, but I still want to say. I've never been into short form content, but I thought I'd give it a try.
