The world is constantly moving, and it can be hard to keep up. Technology and work have become hyper specialized and complex. How is one to keep up with all this?

I used to ask the same question when I started programming. Nothing clicked, and there was technical jargon everywhere. How are we to make sense of this?

Turns out, tech is not that difficult once you spell it out in plain English. Here at TechTea, we do just that: take complex technical topics and break them into easy to understand articles and videos.

We are dedicated to free and open source software as a solution for everyone. Privacy should be the default and not some feature or distant idea. Our goal is to help you find the balance between digital freedom and convenience.

TechTea is here to help make tech work for you, not billion dollar companies.
