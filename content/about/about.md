description: TechTea is here to help you navigate the world of technology.

The world is constantly moving, and it can be hard to keep up. Technology and work have become hyper specialized and complex. How is one to keep up with all this?

I used to ask the same question when I started programming. Nothing clicked, and there was technical jargon everywhere. How are we to make sense of this?

Turns out, tech is not that difficult once you spell it out in plain English. Here at TechTea, we do just that: take complex technical topics and break them into easy to understand articles and videos.

We are dedicated to free and open source software as a solution for everyone. Privacy should be the default and not some feature or distant idea. Our goal is to help you find the balance between digital freedom and convenience.

TechTea is here to help make tech work for you, not billion dollar companies.

## More Info

I'm slowly expanding this website with extra pages and interesting links inspired by other personal websites.

[Stuff I Use](/uses/) - A small list of the hardware and software that I use for my everyday life.  
[Reviews](/reviews) - My thoughts on all sorts of things. Lots of tea, but will also include places, hardware, software, and books eventually.  
[Articles](/articles) - My blog for longer form content. I've been writing off and on since 2013 so there is a lot there and some of questionable quality.  
[Notes](/notes) - Notes are for anything that doesn't require a full long form article, but I still want to say. I've never been into short form content, but I thought I'd give it a try.
