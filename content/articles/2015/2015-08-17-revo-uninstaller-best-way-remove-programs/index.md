Update 2023-06-29: I do not recommend any of this tool anymore. While Windows is still bad at removing programs to this day, it is best to avoid using uninstaller tools and instead use Windows built in tools. Manually delete left over files.

Our computers fill up with a lot of useless programs over the years and many computers come with a lot of useless programs pre-installed, much to our annoyance. You could use Windows built in uninstaller, but it does not do nearly as great of a job as one would want.

## The Problem

Windows uninstaller does not always clean up files programs spread amongst multiple directories or the registry keys left behind in the registry. Some programs cant even be uninstalled from the control panel so you need to find their uninstallers somewhere hidden in Program Files.

## The Solution:

[Revo Uninstaller](http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html), a third party uninstaller that cleans the leftover bits left behind by Windows. Revo Uninstaller has a freeware version and a professional version, but today we will be looking at what is freely available.

First I wish to say two things: Freeware is different than Open-source so read the licensing agreement before you use Revo Uninstaller commercially and be careful when messing with the registry, **if you do not know what you are doing leave it alone.**

After you install Revo Uninstaller you will see a screen full of your installed programs. You can change the view using the view button on the top tool bar if you would prefer a more detailed view or list.

In our Example we will be getting rid of Apple Software Update, but the same principles apply. We will want to double click on the program we wish to uninstall, this will start the uninstaller.

The first options you will be presented with are to run the built in installer, the vary thing we wish to avoid, Safe, Moderate, and Advanced. Most of the time going with Moderate is your best bet. The program explains what each one does in case you wish to do something different. When you hit next it will start the program's default uninstaller. After this Revo Uninstaller will scan for leftovers. If it finds any you will be prompted to clean them.

If you are uninstalling a game for example and the game did not remove old saves or config files, they would show up here. You can select what you want to remove and what Revo Uninstaller should keep. This is the same for the registry. **Do not do anything to the registry unless you know what you are doing** as Revo can make mistakes and you could remove something important to running Windows. Some registry keys are self-explanatory, but most are not. 

Revo Uninstaller has some other tools, but there are [other programs that handle these tasks better](http://www.blog.mattlamont.com/basic-computer-maintenance-tools/). 

You can get Revo Uninstaller at its website [here](http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html).
