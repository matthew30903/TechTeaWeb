Update 2023-06-30: Persona Plus is no longer on Mozilla's website and links have been removed from this article.

Earlier [we mentioned how to customize Firefox](https://www.blog.mattlamont.com/customizing-firefox). Personas are like wallpaper for Firefox and give some basic customization, but what if you wanted to make your own instead of using the ones provided by others?

Fortunately you can with some photo editing and a Firefox addon named Personas Plus. This little addon will give you the ability to create your own personas.

## Creating the Persona Images

To start you will need some images to use as the Firefox Header and Footer. The header is the image that is displayed at the top of your browser, behind the toolbars and tabs. The footer is the image used for the addonbar at the bottom of Firefox. These two images should be simple as to not interfere with text.

The files have specific requirements:

* Header: 3000px x 200px, PNG or JPG format, 300 KB maximum file size.
* Footer: 3000px x 100px, PNG or JPG format, 300 KB maximum file size.

You can use your favorite image editing program to crop larger images to size if you wish or make your own.

## Persona Plus Settings

Now that you have your images, you will need to install Personas Plus. You should find an icon for the addon on your toolbar. When you click on the icon a menu should appear with the option to edit a custom persona. This will give you a menu where you can chose your header, footer, text color, and accent color. Make sure that your colors do not conflict with the persona you made as this will be the text color for the toolbar.

Now you you can have a unique theme for your browser. There are more complicated ways to make and edit Firefox themes, but that would require some css. Perhaps we will touch on it in the future.
