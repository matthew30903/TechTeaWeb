This is not a normal post, but rather an announcement. We are removing our Facebook account.

## Meta's Vision of the Future

Meta, the parent company of Facebook, has shown that it is objectively evil. Our goals at Tech Tea and the goals of our tech overlords are incompatible. Meta wants to control our reality. They are gong to use VR to do so and nobody seems to be concerned enough to take a stand. VR is cool, all our friends are on Facebook and I cannot contact family any other way, etc. Are these good reasons to give up your freedom, to sell your soul to Facebook? I think not.

Meta has a monopoly over social media and VR and is going to use that to try to control the future. They want a world where we do not think, do not own anything, and do not question their authority.

The web used to be bigger back in the early days. Now it is just a few websites that everyone knows about. Back in the old days of IRC and Email it did not matter what provider you used, you could easily use any client and communicate with anyone. Nowadays every chat service needs its own app and there is no way you are going to be able to communicate with someone without both having an account on the same service.

## What are we going to do about it

From this point on we will not be using Facebook for any of our communications. We will still be using the  [fediverse](https://social.techtea.io/@matthew) [(read about it here)](https://www.blog.mattlamont.com/mastodon-gateway-to-the-fediverse/), twitter (also evil, but can be used without giving up our freedom), and occasionally our email list. 

We do not take this decision lightly, I used Facebook personally for over 10 years. Most of the people I know use it or another one of Meta's products. Most of them are not going to leave if just because I tell them to and many will not use another form of communication because everyone they know is on Facebook. 

I seek a world where we are in control of our data, who we communicate with, and how we interact with technology. Meta, Google, and all the other big tech companies are our enemy. We need to stand against them. We should not let Meta decide for us. Tech Tea's mission is to destroy big tech, help others find freedom and control, and make tech easier to use in a way that respects us.

Tech Tea's goal this year is to help spread Digital Independence and freedom. Expect more posts from us this year covering how to take control over your digital life as well as alternative tech platforms that can replace the ones that seek to control us.
