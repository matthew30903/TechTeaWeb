A lot of us hear the word ```ping``` used a lot in gaming and when we are having network issues, but what exactly is ping?

## ping

ping is a command line tool that is used to measure the round-trip time for messages sent from one computer to another. This is often used to test if there is a connection between your computer and a website.

You can use it by opening a command line and running the command with the following arguments based off of your operating systemf;

| -Q tos               | Set Quality of Service -related bits in ICMP datagrams. tos can be either decimal or hex number. Traditionally (RFC1349), these have been interpreted as: 0 for reserved (currently being redefined as congestion control), 1-4 for Type of Service and 5-7 for Precedence. Possible settings for Type of Service are: minimal cost: 0x02, reliability: 0x04, throughput: 0x08, low delay: 0x10. Multiple TOS bits should not be set simultaneously. Possible settings for special Precedence range from priority (0x20) to net control (0xe0). You must be root (CAP_NET_ADMIN capability) to use Critical or higher precedence value. You cannot set bit 0x01 (reserved) unless ECN has been enabled in the kernel. In RFC2474, these fields has been redefined as 8-bit Differentiated Services (DS), consisting of: bits 0-1 of separate data (ECN will be used, here), and bits 2-7 of Differentiated Services Codepoint (DSCP). |

| -w deadline          | Specify a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or received. In this case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline expire or until count probes are answered or for some error notification from network.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| -W timeout           | Time to wait for a response, in seconds. The option affects only timeout in absense of any responses, otherwise ping waits for two RTTs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

Note: Linux uses ping and ping6 to distinuish between IPv4 and IPv6

## Use Case
If you are having issues connecting to the internet many will try to test the issue by sending a ping request to a known working website. We will use google.com in this example.
If we run the command ```ping google.com``` we should get the following output:

```
Pinging google.com [172.217.5.78] with 32 bytes of data:
Reply from 172.217.5.78: bytes=32 time=22ms TTL=53
Reply from 172.217.5.78: bytes=32 time=26ms TTL=53
Reply from 172.217.5.78: bytes=32 time=23ms TTL=53
Reply from 172.217.5.78: bytes=32 time=68ms TTL=53
Ping statistics for 172.217.5.78:
   Packets: Sent = 4, Received = 4, Lost = 0 (0% loss),
Approximate round trip times in milli-seconds:
    Minimum = 22ms, Maximum = 68ms, Average = 34ms
```
If all our packets get replies then we have a good connection. If some of them are lost it could mean that there is some network interference preventing a stable connection. If all of them are lost then we are looking at three different possible issues:

1.  The website is down.
2.  You are not connected to the internet.
3.  You are having DNS problems.

We can test number 3 by typing in the IP Address of the website you wish to ping. If you get no packets then the issue is not likely a DNS issue. If you receive your packets then we may be able to fix the issue by flushing our DNS Resolver Catch with ```ipconfig /flushdns```. To learn more about [ipconfig look at our article here](https://www.blog.mattlamont.com/ipconfig-a-guide/).
