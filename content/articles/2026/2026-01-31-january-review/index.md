description: A lot has happened this month. Lets go over what has been going on in my world and share some fun links. 
---

This is the first month of the year and it has been a rough one. So many things have been happening across the country I currently reside in and it has effected the personal lives of some very close friends. People I know are afraid to go outside for fear of being kidnapped by masked goons because they are "undesirable" to the current regime. Some are afraid of being shot. I don't follow the news too closely, but every day word comes out that the kids up in Washington and their followers have done something awful again. The administration has the audacity to lie to our faces about what is going on even when we catch them on camera. I'm glad that the peaceful protests are working, but it is slow progress. 

In the United States the majority have turned a blind eye to the crimes of the country because it either didn't affect them, they were too comfortable to care, or they only learned about what was done to them 50 years later when the vile acts were declassified. Now we are all too poor and too educated to pacify with material goods or ignorance. As the protesters in Minneapolis and across the country have shown, protest can be effective in pushing back against this regime. This is a chance to put an end to U.S. backed oppression, not just domestically, but across the world. Hopefully the momentum gained here through all the pain and hardship can push us into a more beautiful era, but that is a blog post for another time.

On a less political note, I've been watching Monk with my girlfriend and it has been fun. It is her first time watching the series and I've not seen it in years nor have I ever completed it. It is a very fun, but heartfelt show. Though comedic there is a sense of reverence for the mental health issues it jokes about. 

## Video Games

I didn't finish any games or really play anything new this month, but I did touch upon some of the games I was either already playing or ones I've not played in a long time, but have in the past.

The Sims 2 is an old one that I played about two hours of on a random afternoon. This is a game from my teen years that my sisters and I had a lot of fun with. There is so many little and charming interactions in the game. You can feel that it is from an era when games were not as cynical as they are now. It is still a buggy mess and all the expansions released were a money sink, but it doesn't feel nearly as terrible as modern AAA games. I might give this a serious playthough in the coming months.

Fantasy Life i and Atelier Sophie were the major games this month. Fantasy Life is mostly played multiplayer with my partner so I've not made much progress in the story or unlocking anything new since unlocking the Artist life. Sophie has been a slow grind towards completion and has been a lot of fun.

Factorio. A few days ago I was completely spent due to a combination of personal life stuff I can't get into and the people in my life panicking about the current events going on in the world. I sat down for several hours and played some Factorio and for the first time in what felt like weeks I was feeling like me again. This game is as intellectually stimulating as it is addicting and playing it felt like a good reset after being down for a few weeks, doing nothing very stimulating.

Cyberpunk 2077. I know I said I was done, but I had to try a melee build. Katana and knife throwing build. It has been fun. Not enough to make me sink nearly as much time into it as I did in the past, but I will likely jump on it every once in a while when I need a more action type of game.

### Projects

The Dev Atlas built a [cool website](https://thedevatlas.com/Taco-Bell-Crawler/) using scraped Taco Bell menu data for all US locations that can display the price difference for individual menu items between locations. If you wanted to use Taco Bell as a cost of living index metric you got it here. He also has a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aNPiar2bCW4) where he loosely goes over how he made the site.

### Articles

JA Westenberg wrote a [case for blogging](https://www.joanwestenberg.com/the-case-for-blogging-in-the-ruins/). They make a claim you have all seen before, but bears repeating; It gives you and your readers control, it allows for true intellectual and nuanced writing on the internet, and the 'old internet' never died, it is just waiting for you to join. They also provide a few links to blogging platforms you can use to get your thoughts online and public. 

Discovery on the web is a struggle for the unmotivated thanks to AI slop and bad search engines, but Alex has a [handy guide for finding some goodies on the web](https://thatalexguy.dev/posts/small-web-discovery/). Unlike my post about the subject he included Gemini, pubnix, and BBS servers as well as websites. Really cool.

Artyom Bologov wrote about [Boredom being good and important](https://aartaka.me/boredom.html). Maybe less about just Boredom and more about doing things or doing nothing for their own sake, not trying to be productive. 

Lars-Christian is [buying fancy wool socks](https://lars-christian.com/posts/2026-01-08-buying-socks/). Before you click away, hear me out. I suffered with many swiftly worn socks over my life just as he has. It sucks and it gets expensive fast. As a person who did not grow up with the means to get nice socks this was how it was up till my mid 20s. Then I found out about the Darn Tough brand and their lifetime warranty on socks, they cost over $20 USD a pair, but I've yet to need to replace any of them and I abuse them. I still have a few threadbare cotton socks hanging on, but they will soon be on their way out. I hope Lars-Christian's experiment is as successful as my own was, I'm a wool socks for life person now and think most people should be too.

Terence Eden wrote a great article [about how out of touch and devoid of natural love tech-bros are](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/12/agentic-ai-is-brilliant-because-i-loath-my-family/). There are use cases for computers (who would have thunk?), but removing the love and humanity from human interaction should not be one of them. The story is of someone having gen AI write a bedtime story for their kid because they had no creativity or love. A tech-bro would find it amazing that they just saved time having to come up with a bedtime story, they probably would have a bot tell it to their kid too if they could. I want tech to make our lives easier so we can be more human, not remove the human element in the name of 'productivity' or some other garbage.

Speaking of AI, Anthropic released a sales [pitch/vague threat to the public](https://www.anthropic.com/news/disrupting-AI-espionage) about how their AI can be used to carry out cyberattacks and everyone needs to jump on the AI bandwagon so they can defend themselves with AI. Jim Nielsen [shared his thoughts about this on his blog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2026/ai-security-shakedown/). I just wanted to echo what he said, AI companies don't have a good ethics track record. Anthropic is like Monsanto and AI is like [Roundup and the roundup resistant crops they sell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roundup_(herbicide)). They created a problem and now are willing to sell you the supposed solution to the problem. It is the same thing with AI search supposedly fixing search because AI broke search. Why in the world would I use your product that puts a band-aid on the problem you created? Why should I trust you when your whole existence as a company relies on bullying, threatening, and stealing from those who are less powerful than you? AI companies need to be put down and anyone with decision-making power within them should be criminally charged.

One more AI Thing, Matthew Inman from The Oatmeal [wrote a comic addressing the lack of soul and fear some artists feel when it comes to AI slop](https://theoatmeal.com/comics/ai_art). It is heartfelt and thoughtful. Give it a look.

Dylan Araps, of Neofetch and many other amazing open source programs fame, [quit the internet a few years ago, found God, and picked up farming](https://dylan.gr/1768295794). Yes, the meme about software devs quitting to do something with their hands is alive and true. He gave this update post and I thought it was interesting. It sounds like he is happy and healthy. While I'm unlikely to give up meat, let alone animal products, or my life in tech, I do think most people working in knowledge work get the intrusive thought to just drop everything and go work on a farm, become a carpenter, or do some other carrier that doesn't so closely involve sitting in front of a screen for 8+ hours a day. While I don't agree with everything he says, the new blog he has created gives some insights into his world view that are interesting to read. Give this and the rest of his blog a read if you have time.

### Videos

Alec from Technology Connections discusses [why we need to move to renewables and how the lies told by people who profit from oil are just that, lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KtQ9nt2ZeGM). He also goes on a rant, urging people to vote and protest against the current oppressive regime in the United States, something that aligns perfectly with everything else he has said over the years. The fact that the Republican Party froze money that would go towards renewable energy infrastructure to fund a private army that attacks what they see as "undesirables" is one of many crimes that needs to be punished to the full extent of the law and without mercy. Not saying the other party in this country is good by any means, but they don't publically murder people and lie about it and they seem to care about the future over short term gains.  

Darbin Orvar goes over some tips for [building bookshelves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2j2zXOIp5Kk). This one is fun. I wish I owned my place so we could have some built-ins, right now I'm just using simple Ikea Billy bookcases. One day I'll have a nice home library to share with the people in my life. A man can dream.  

Patrick Boyle goes over [how algorithmic censorship and self-censorship on platforms like YouTube are harmful to online discourse and democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJP6K2_rr90). He recently did a video on how Epstein and his co-conspirators enjoyed bipartisan protection over the decades. His analysis was focused on the failures of a justice system that gives the wealthy and corporations freedom from consequences that would result in a far stronger punishment for someone who was less wealthy. YouTube demonetized his video and stopped promoting it across the platform, discouraging discussion of the topic. This is a common practice online (sometimes called shadow-banning) that makes it hard to get more serious topics pushed before larger audiences. He also critiques the self-censorship some people have started doing where they censor words either by bleeping them out or by replacing them with something silly, completely destroying the gravity of the conversation. We shouldn't be playing their game, even on their platforms. This is another example of social media trying to remove nuance and true discussion from public discourse in favor of profit and likely control over said discussion.  

Hobby Built made a cool little [entryway coat rack, mirror, weather forecast thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT9LqeZuvFs). You already know I like projects like this. It is a cool one to give a look at. Hobby Built always makes interesting projects.

Bread has another awesome tutorial/call to action video. This time [she goes through her workflow with Kednlive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dIqJDy78TI) and calls people who are interested in making things to just make them, regardless of software. I've used Adobe Premier (CS 6, no one in their right mind is paying adobe a monthly fee for hobby creative projects), Cyberlink Power Director, Lightworks, and a few other open source video editors. Power Director was the best of the bunch for basic editing and Premier crashed too often to be useful. Kdenlive has been the best of the open source video editors and is what I use when I need to do edits to a video nowadays. If you are looking into proprietary stuff I'd say go with Resolve (I don't use it, but a friend of mine does) or Power Director if your needs are simple. Kdenlive is awesome though and would be my first choice for anyone getting started in video editing. Only use Adobe if you absolutely need it.

## The New year

There has been a lot of good and a lot of bad last year. I think this year is going to be much brighter though. Even if the powers that be try to bring us down, I think we will come out on top.

I hope you have a wonderful new year full of joy, love, and growth.
