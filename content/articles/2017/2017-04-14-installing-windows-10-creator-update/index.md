Microsoft provides a way to skip the line when it comes to updates. This tool is the Update Assistant. You can download it from Microsoft's website [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).

Once downloaded you can run the updater, it may take some time.

Many small improvements have been made, privacy is better, new ads in the start menu, a game mode for video games, 3D paint, and more.
