Update 2023-06-30: I do not recommend Launchy anymore as Windows Powertools has this feature and it is open source. Also Windows Search features are rather good now. Most major Linux tools desktops already have great application launchers as well so there is no point in using it.

The less time you use the mouse the faster you can navigate a computer. That said, sometimes keyboard shortcuts are not enough. When you need to launch programs or search for a file quickly for example. Enter in [Launchy, the open source application launcher](http://www.launchy.net/about.php).

## Launchy: What is it and how it works

{{< figure src="./img/1_Launchy.png" alt="Image: Launchy App">}}

Launchy is a program that lets you open programs and files on your computer. All you have to do is press the keyboard shortcut (Default is alt+space) and start typing the name of the program or file. You can add new files to the program's search database, but any program that adds items to the start menu or desktop should automatically be added.

You can [download Launchy form its website](http://www.launchy.net/download.php). After installing let the program build a database. The time this takes will depend on how many programs you have installed.

### Program Settings

The first thing you will want to do after installing is go through the settings. To do so, press alt+space on your keyboard. This will open up the search window. Before typing anything click the gear icon in the topmost right hand corner.

In the general settings you will find the ability to edit the user interface, setup internet proxy settings, control how many options appear in the suggestion list, and some general options for how the program behaves.

These settings are explanatory for the most part.

The next tab is the skin settings, you can customize the way the program looks here. You can find [new skins on Devientart](http://www.deviantart.com/browse/all/customization/skins/applaunchers/launchy/). Just place the skin's folder in the program's skin folder (Default: C:\Program Files (x86)\Launchy\skins).

The catalog is where things get interesting. This is Launchy's heart.

Launchy will scan the files in the directories you chose. If the file matches the file types set in the list to the right, it will appear when you type. Press the plus (+) sign to add new paths and file types and minus (-) sign to remove them. Including executables will allow you to directly launch a program, but I recommend that you use shortcuts to do such work. Directories will let you search the directories and launch an explorer window to them. I recommend that you keep this unchecked as well.

The last tab is for Plugins. These extend Launchy's abilities beyond what it can do be default. This includes Calcy for performing math calculations and Weby for searching the web directly from Launchy. As there is too much variation with plugins, they will not be covered here. You can toggle them on and off with the check boxes in the left window.

Now you can launch any program on your computer from the keyboard. You will save time, improve your typing speed, and not have to deal with the start menu.

What would you like us to cover next?
