I just started this blog.

I just got Cairo-Dock working on my Linux computer. I don't know why I need a dock, but it was hard to instal and it looks nice now that I got it working. It is very customizable and even has an application launcher. It was designed for the Gnome desktop environment, so it did not look so nice until I modified it to look good on KDE. It looks like it was always there, now if I was not to afraid to install Compiz fusion, I would have a desktop that looks like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QokOwvPxrE)

I have Kwin, it can't do half of the stuff that can and it still amazes people. Just imagine if I did this. Of Course I am running off a laptop so I do not have a powerful graphics card. If I do too much, I might crash my computer.
