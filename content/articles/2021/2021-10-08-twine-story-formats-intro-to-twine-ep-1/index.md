Video covering the topic is available on [Odysee](https://odysee.com/$/embed/TwineTutotialEP1/5f858496c011d1f89a025c265abad1867d6b01da?r=GQy7ehkBjb8ALbSkfEZU5jPc4S785Nch) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbFdzPjc4Uk)

[Last time](https://www.blog.mattlamont.com/twine-a-game-engine-for-interactive-fiction/) we discussed what twine is and how it works. Today we will cover the Twine 2 story formats. Story formats are a way to add logic and mechanics to twine.

This is the second in a series of videos about the Twine Game Engine.

In the future we will write an accompanying article for each of our video uploads. Till then please consider following us on Odysee at: [@TechTea](https://odysee.com/$/invite/@TechTea:2).
