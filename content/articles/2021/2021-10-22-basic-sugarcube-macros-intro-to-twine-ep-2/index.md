[Last time](https://www.blog.mattlamont.com/twine-story-formats-intro-to-twine-ep-1/) we covered the various story formats in the Twine 2 game engine. Today we are going to add logic to our game using SugarCube's Macro system and make a door that needs a key to open.



You can find SugarCube's docs [here](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/).

In the future we will write an accompanying article for each of our video uploads. Till then please consider following us on Odysee at: [@TechTea](https://odysee.com/$/invite/@TechTea:2).
