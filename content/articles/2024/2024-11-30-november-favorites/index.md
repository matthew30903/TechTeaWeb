description: I've read and watched a lot of stuff this month. Here are the highlights. I hope you find something you didn't know about before.
---

The year is almost over and somehow I've published one of these favorites articles each month so far. I'm going to change up the format next year, but think it has been a worthwhile thing to do. Taking what I've consumed, curating it down to things I felt were meaningful, and adding my own commentary has been useful for me and hopefully entertaining for those who read it.

## General

### Pilot Custom 74 Fountain Pen

I finally got my first gold nib fountain pen. Analogue writing is the best way to write and a good pen makes it all the better. My chicken scratch is very small so I like fine or extra fine nibs, the Japanese brands generally have finer nibs than western brands and I've been using a Pilot Metropolitan for a long time so it is fitting that I would get another Pilot pen.

I tested several in a store including the Pilot E95s and Vanishing point, but this one felt the best in my hands at my budget. I got a blue one with an extra fine nib.

For people who have never tried using a fountain pen before I'd recommend looking into it. They don't need to be very expensive, can last you a lifetime, and genuinely feel better to write with once you get used to it.

### [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app)

I used Nextcloud News for my RSS reader/server for a while. It syncs with a mobile client and Newsboat on desktop, has a web interface, and generally worked well. The problem is that the web interface has been broken for a while now and I also don't like relying on my nextcloud server for everything. Enter [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app), a light weight and easy to use RSS reader.

It works with multiple mobile clients if you need it, works as a PWA if you don't want another app installed on your phone, and works with Newsboat. Been using it for a few weeks now and there have been no issues after struggling to get everything working with a reverse proxy on my home network.

I learned about the project from Ruben Schade's [blog post](https://rubenerd.com/which-self-hosted-rss-reader-do-you-use/) asking people about what RSS reader they use. 

On a somewhat related note; Omnivore, the read-it-later service I occasionally used, merged into a questionable AI Company and shut down their service so I am thinking of a better way to archive important articles that has an easy API to interface with. I rarely used it, but if you have any recommendation let me know.

## Articles

### [On Working With Your Passion](https://www.datagubbe.se/passion/) by Carl Svensson

Carl Svensson talks about the dream of working in tech, the reality, and passion about what you work on.

It is a good, somewhat melancholic, read.

### [Evaluating book summary services](https://rubenerd.com/evaluating-book-summary-services/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade talks about his experience with a book summary service. He concludes in the end that they may seem like a simple way to save time, but that assumes they are accurate. Books are often more complex than the words on the page and a summary service will likely not help get to the essence of what the book is about unless the person who is writing that summary has spent a lot of time with the book, something that is unlikely to be economical. 

### [We can't be informed about everything](https://rubenerd.com/we-cant-be-informed-about-everything/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben reminds us that we all need to start somewhere and no one has all the answers.

It is really hard to know where to start or try something that you might fail nowadays as everyone expects everyone else to be an expert in everything. The truth is that most of us know only a little bit about the world outside our very specific interests and even then we are not infallible.

### [Fortress of Solitude](https://starbreaker.org/blog/personal/fortress-of-solitude/index.html) by Matthew Graybosch (Starbreaker)

Matthew Graybosch talks about an email he got criticizing the fact he doesn't have a presence on social media or a comment section or any of the other trappings of what some believe is a necessary part of being online. They complain that it is hard to get a hold of him or that it isn't very social.

Matthew points out how backwards and entitled this thinking is. 

For a lot of people a personal website is a place to be themselves in a somewhat public, but controlled way. Personal websites and the people who run them aren't beholden to the rules of the corporate garbage patch people call social media.  

I wish that this kind of scenario was made up and that people weren't this comically rude and entitled, but if you have ever seen a post on hackernews, the site formerly known as twitter, or any of those other awful sites you would know that this is standard behavior for many people online. Not all, not even most, but the loud minority are very, very loud.

For Matthew his website is his Fortress of Solitude, even if it is on the public web. He doesn't need to cater to anyone but himself.

As a side note, I've shared a few emails with Matthew in the past, he honestly isn't that hard to get a hold of and from my limited interactions seems a great guy.

### [They want your ethics for $105](https://ntietz.com/blog/ethics-105-dollars/) by Nicole Tietz-Sokolsaya

Nicole talks about an email she received recently from a shady company trying to buy links to their equally shady website.

At the end of the day Nicole doesn't think people should sell their ethics and soul for a few bucks and betray the trust of their readers. I have to agree. 

There is nothing wrong with sponsorships as long as they are done ethically, publicly, and have true value to the reader. But if you are selling out for $105 USD, you are not valuing yourself our your readers enough.

### [Black, White, and Grey](https://so1o.xyz/blog/black-white-grey) by so1o

so1o talks about morality, american exceptionalism, and the move to ban tiktok. I agree with most of what was said. 

The whole move to ban tiktok in the US is not run by privacy advocates, but people who are a little brainwashed into thinking anything from China is bad. The app is toxic garbage, but so is most things being put out by american companies. We should ban all of them: Google, Facebook, Netflix, Apple, Amazon, and all the other companies that do harm to all of us. 

There is a lot to be said about american exceptionalism in general, but I'll probably need to save that for another post.

Also truth is objective, dates should be formatted YYYY/MM/DD. 

### [How I name my computers](https://alexwlchan.net/2024/how-i-name-my-computers/) by Alex China

Alex talks about how she names her computers after mythological figures that start with the letter P. It is a cute idea. Found her website via Robb Knight's own [post on the subject](https://rknight.me/blog/naming-my-computers/).

I've tried naming my computers, but they usually end up with the name Matthew's [model number] or after their purpose like Docker01 and TrueNAS02. Not the most creative, but I can easily find them on the network. 

### [An appreciation of the “mark all as read” button](https://manuelmoreale.com/an-appreciation-of-the-mark-all-as-read-button) by Manuel Moreale

Manu writes about how wonderful RSS is and his love for the "mark all as read" button.

It is truly a wonderful thing to be able to read quality stuff written by humans that is curated by you or another human. It is lovely to not have an algorithm constantly trying to hook you or people trying to sell you things all the time. And at the end of the day you can mark everything as read so it doesn't keep bothering you. That is the enduring power of RSS and a good feed reader.

### [Small scale is the best scale](https://manuelmoreale.com/small-scale-is-the-best-scale) by Manuel Moreale

Another one by Manu that I resinate with. When things start growing large they often become unappealing as they lose the human element. 

I don't think this is always the case, but in the world of the capitalistic internet where a million people is considered a small community the term large scale is ridiculous. I don't think I could even keep up with even a hundred on a regular bases. The large creators and platforms have to manage so many people, bots, interactions, etc that there is no room for genuine human interaction.

### [Repairing My Sony Ear Buds](https://kevquirk.com/blog/repairing-my-sony-ear-buds) by Kev Quirk

Kev Quirk talked [earlier](https://kevquirk.com/blog/my-sony-earbuds-are-dead) about how his Sony earbuds were having battery issues. He tried replacing the battery and that fixed his issues. 

It is always nice to see people fixing what they own rather than letting things end up in a landfill. 

### [Forums are still alive](https://rscottjones.com/forums-are-still-alive/) by Scott

Scott mentions that forms are still alive and mentions a few of them. None that are of interest to me personally, but it is a great reminder that "social media" and the fediverse aren't the only social places on the web.

### [Capture less than you create](https://world.hey.com/dhh/capture-less-than-you-create-c30e462e) by David Heinemeier Hansson

David Heinemeier Hansson is the creator of Ruby on Rails, the software that many of the largest companies in the world use. He talks about how envy is the death of the open source spirit and how one should not lust after the success of others.

This is most likely in response to the recent wordpress drama, but even outside of that context he is mostly right. 

People should be paid for their work and if you succeed on the backs of other projects it is only right to support those projects and their creators, but creators aren't entitled to it. Resentment is growing in the open source world over companies that take more than they give back, but that is a threat to the open source sprit. It is hard not to be resentful, but also those who publish under an open license should know that they have chosen to give their work freely without any expectation of anything in return.

We probably need a better model in the future (tax big tech companies and put it into a tech fund for open source), but right now this is the world we have.

### ["If buying isn't owning, piracy isn't stealing"](https://pluralistic.net/2023/12/08/playstationed/#tyler-james-hill) by Cory Doctorow

Cory Doctorow shares his own thoughts about DRM, the evil things companies are doing, and how we shouldn't be complacent in enshittification or companies altering the terms of the sell.

This is an older article, but still very relevant today.

### [Fountain Pens: Writing My Way Out of a Poverty Mindset](https://marisabel.nl/public/blog/Fountain_Pens:_Writing_My_Way_Out_of_a_Poverty_Mindset) by Marisabel Munoz

Marisabel Munoz talks about the poverty mindset and how hard it can be to justify buying gifts for oneself, even when you are comfortably well off. Using and owning fountain pens has helped her enjoy the fruits of her labor more and is helping her break free from that mindset.

As someone who just splurged on their first expensive fountain pen I completely understand the trepidation with buying luxury items. 

## Videos

### [It's up to us to save Video Games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFINynRcFtk) by Modern Vintage Gamer

Modern Vintage Gamer talks about how US copyright and game publishers are preventing game preservation. Games are being de-listed from digital store fronts and physical releases are becoming rarer every day. Many modern games have DRM that makes them hard to run outside the system they were designed for, need persistent connection to proprietary servers to play, etc. 

Publishers have shown that they don't care about video games as an artistic medium or the preservation of them so it falls onto gamers and people who do care to preserve these games.

How? Developing emulators, sharing ROM files, lobbying, buying DRM free games, and creating 3rd party servers for games that do need them. None of this is easy, but if nothing is done games will be lost forever. 

### [I built a RISC CPU in Excel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MNRKi7Rum_c) by Inkbox

Inkbox made a CPU a while back in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, but it was slow and unwieldy. This time around he reduced the instruction set and created a much faster and more organized CPU in the program.

I always love seeing projects like this, but they are made even better when people like Inkbox describe their thinking process and infrastructure. Worth a watch if you like computers.

### [I Almost Threw Away a $165 Kettle - Fellow Stagg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upInU4-gkKY) by David Likes Coffee

David talks about the importance of Right to Repair and how to replace a thermal fuse in a Fellow Stagg Kettle. I use the same kettle for my tea and would be very upset if I couldn't fix a problem with it, glad to see people sharing repair tips online.

### [Turning Old Moosebone into Treasure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQt2tkDPQIE) by Betting On Alaska

Mick from Betting On Alaska tries bone work for the first time. He found some moose bones and carved a heron in one of them. It is always awesome to see people make cool stuff out of things that would otherwise go to waste. 

As people who regular read my blog know, watching people make things is one of my guilty pleasures. I should really be making more things myself.

### [Hasbro Ruined Magic (You Can Fix It)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdqGrOudmdM) by Eerie Island

Clint from Eerie Island made a format for Magic the Gathering that looks interesting. I'm a fan of slower games, but Hasbro took full control over my favorite format so I'm looking forward to trying out new ways to play MTG.

Check out the cube as well as the basic instructions he created on [Cube Cobra](https://cubecobra.com/cube/overview/buyandbattle).

One of the coolest things about MTG is that it isn't a single game, but instead of medium for many related games.

### [How Jesus Turned Me into a Marxist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wrbo2BuD_0M) by Michael Burns

Michael Burns (one of the hosts of WiseCrack) talks about how he grew into Marxism via his christian religious experience. The Jesus to Marxist pipeline is a real thing.

Many people will look at american evangelicals and misguided fundamentalists as if they were the example of what Christianity as a whole represents. This leads to many seeing religion as a evil thing, but there are whole branches of Christianity motivated by the same or similar ideals as Marx had.

As someone who leans towards the liberation theology side of christianity myself, I can see how Michael and many others came to this conclusion. 

### [I Made The Ultimate Cheating Device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bicjxl4EcJg) by ChromaLock

ChromaLock made a ESP32 based extension board for the TI-84 calculator that lets it connect to a server and run programs from a remote location. This includes prompting OpenAI and getting responses, chatting with other modded calculators, and viewing images.

A rather cool idea. 

### [Stoicism: An In-Depth Explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggkd_uyDqz8) by Jared Henderson

Jared Henderson talks about the history and ideas of the Stoics including the things that most modern productivity bros and stoics leave out, the metaphysics. 

Stoicism is an amazing and interesting school of philosophy, but often gets misrepresented or filtered into only the practical application without any explanation of how stoics got to a particular conclusion in the first place.

### [Using a Notebook (This Way) Still Beats Every Productivity App](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U24y_QdPDZ4) by Bullet Journal

Ryder Carroll, the creator of the Bullet Journal method, talks about how notebooks are an amazing technology when paired with his method for living intentionally.

I'm a big fan of pen and paper for any deep work that needs to be done. Not only is there [strong evidence](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full) that it is better for you, it also is just more fun and satisfying.

As Ryder Carroll mentioned in the video, a notebook helps you use the conceptual technologies we develop. It is a way to cultivate ourselves, away from constant outside pressure or influence.

### [$2 vs $40,000 Notre Dame Marble Run](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wIBeji5W0h8) by Masked Marble

Masked Marble makes a giant model of Notre Dame using GraviTrax marble run kits. This is basically an ad for the GraviTrax toys, but it is truly impressive and worth taking a look at.
