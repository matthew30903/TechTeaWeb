## News

The news is often purposely full of negativity and polarizing issues to get us to click and good journalism is in short supply, but there is some good news out there. 

### [Attorney General Merrick B. Garland Delivers Remarks on Lawsuit Against Apple for Monopolizing Smartphone Markets](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-merrick-b-garland-delivers-remarks-lawsuit-against-apple-monopolizing) by the United States Department of Justice

We all know Apple has been actively harmful towards their developers and users. When the EU forced them to comply with EU laws they responded with gratuitous malicious compliance to hold their monopoly.

It looks like here in the US Attorney General Merrick Garland is going to attempt to hold Apple accountable for their actions.

> Now, having monopoly power does not itself violate the antitrust laws.
> 
> But it does when a firm acquires or maintains monopoly power — not because it has a superior product or superior business acumen — but by engaging in exclusionary conduct.
> 
> As set out in our complaint, Apple has maintained its power not because of its superiority, but because of its unlawful exclusionary behavior.
> 
> Monopolies like Apple's threaten the free and fair markets upon which our economy is based. They stifle innovation; they hurt producers and workers; and they increase costs for consumers. 
> 
> If left unchallenged, Apple will only continue to strengthen its smartphone monopoly.

Apple has proven multiple times that it cannot be trusted to regulate itself and it will do anything to keep their users locked in its ecosystem. I do hope that the DOJ's lawsuit succeeds and sets a precedence for taking on other gatekeeper companies like ISPs, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft.

## Cool Projects

So there are a lot of cool projects out there and I will probably forget about the ones I haven't had a chance to play with if I don't bookmark them. I may as well share them with you as well.

### [Atuin](https://atuin.sh)

This is a tool I started using this month. Basically it gives you very detailed command history for your terminal shell, lets you sync your command history across multiple devices, and gives you basic statistics about your commands. 

The main feature I use it for is the better command history. Normally in most shells you press the up arrow and it will move up through your command history one command at a time. With Atuin you can see a list of your command history, search it, and a little more. I've used it a lot

I haven't used the syncing feature as I don't usually use other computers from my main desktop, but I might play around with it sometime in the future.

In any case, if you work within the terminal for any amount of time you may find it useful.

### [deej](https://github.com/omriharel/deej)

deej is an open source physical audio mixer that works with Windows and Linux. The project lets you use an arduino to control multiple audio streams on your computer.

I don't have the means to build this project right now, but this would be very useful for my work and maybe some of my hobbies. 

### [Valetudo](https://valetudo.cloud)

Valetudo is an open source software that lets people own their robot vacuums instead of being shackled to cloud providers with bad security records. 

I made the statement that I would never allow a robot vacuum in my home due to the issues with IoT ("smart") devices. The major issues being the lack of replicability, dependence on a cloud provider that could disappear any day, and security issues among many other issues. 

Valetudo fixes that by overwriting the firmware on the robots so they can be used locally, without the need for internet or a phone. This means you don't need to worry about the vendor charging you monthly fees, spying on you, or otherwise violating your rights. You can now own it and use it without worry. 

If I ever get a robot vacuum I'll be sure to try out Valetudo and see how well it works in the real world. 

### [USBvalve](https://github.com/cecio/USBvalve)

USBvalve is basically an advanced USB condom. It lets you detect what a USB device is trying to do and stop it. Lets say you find a random USB drive and want to see if it is infected or is a USB Rubber Ducky before plugging it into your computer. You can also use it to see if a charging cable is compromised before plugging in your phone. 

While there are other devices out there that just remove the data pins from a USB connection that doesn't really tell you what is actually going on. 

This will definitely be a project I will build one day.

## Cool, Fun, or otherwise Useful Websites

### [The Grug Brained Developer](https://grugbrain.dev)

Subtitled *A layman's guide to thinking like the self-aware smol brained*, this website has some great thoughts on how to keep software projects from growing into unmanageable messes because someone thought of a "smarter" way to do something.

A lof of developers get trapped by their own big brained solutions to simple problems and it is usually avoidable. Grug tells us how to avoid some of these problems by being a little more self-aware and small brained about things.

While it may sound silly, just look at the new JavaScript framework coming out every few days. They are almost always overly complicated underneath, need complex tooling, and have hundreds of dependencies all to make "Hello world" appear on the screen and use 2MB of bandwidth. Don't overthink things.

For the most part it boils down to complexity is usually bad, don't make things more complicated than they need to be.

### [Melon's Website](https://melonking.net)

The web revival movement is similar to the indieweb, but very clearly leans towards early web nostalgia with a pair of thick rose tinted glasses. This means lots of animations, background music, and generally fun web design.

Melon's website is like that, a bit random and still a place I need to explore more. I love how the sidebar navigation plays an elevator animation and the background sounds and music lean more towards coziness than distracting.

Also the website is closed on Monday.  

Worth a look at for sure.

## Blogs

Blogs and personal websites are probably the best places to find insightful and interesting content nowadays. There are many other types of interesting website, but blogs are probably the most human. Here are some of the highlights of this month. Feel free to send me links to your blog or other ones you think are interesting.

### [I miss human curation](https://blog.cassidoo.co/post/human-curation/) by Cassidy Williams

Back in the days of StumbleUpon, web directories, and more open social media platforms it was much easier to find human curated things to read, watch, and otherwise interact with. Things were not dictated by some algorithm trying to keep you stuck on a specific platform for as long as possible. It was more easy to find more interesting things that you could talk about with your friends.

Cassidy talks about this on her blog post. Fortunately we are starting to see an era of more personal websites. Unfortunately the mechanisms that we use to find these websites are not as easy to find. With search engines moving into uselessness, AI generated content being [curated by other AI](https://techtea.io/articles/2024/arch-search-ai/), and every 3rd space on the internet aggressively pushing towards [enshittification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification) it is hard to see the vibrant world just beneath the surface on the internet.

The good news is once you find one personal website, you are more likely to find a bunch of others. How? Well through posts like this one you are reading now or most of the other blogs I've linked to. Many personal websites are funded out of pocket of their creators with no profit motive. This means they are more willing to share other websites with you rather than keep you glued to their platform. 

As for the notifications problem, that is something we need to figure out as a society, but RSS helps a little.

### [How do do you connect retrocomputers to the web?](https://rubenerd.com/how-do-you-connect-retrocomputers-to-the-web/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade explains that retro computers are his hobby and escape from socializing and productive tinkering. Connecting them to the internet is contrary to those things.

Tinkering for the sake of tinkering is a major hobby of mine and I can see how connecting a device to the internet can disrupt that mood. I rarely fully disconnect though as a lot of answers and documentation is online. I should just download all of the docs and keep them handy before diving into a project.

### [Mastodon and public data](https://www.manton.org/2024/02/15/mastodon-and-public.html) by Manton Reece

Manton Reece is the creator of the IndieWeb blog hosting platform micro.blog. Here he writes about how one of the principles of Activity Pub and Mastodon are to promote an open web, but many Mastodon users are actually against such a thing.

Every time a platform like Bluesky, Threads or or some other big player that could help make Mastodon go mainstream and improve interoperability between platforms they say it will harm the users and the Fediverse. Having these large platforms work with Mastodon though is a big win for the decentralized web and means more people will be able to discover the Fediverse in the future.

I at least thing the solution is to give users better moderation controls so they can decide what they want to see on their feeds. It might be a little harsh to the people who are genuinely threatened by the toxic culture of mainstream social media, but their posts are already public, the point of a social media platform is to publicly post content and get it seen by others, and if they are harmed by others reading their post then they should not be posting to a publicly accessible website. The user should be able to filter out what they don't want to see and post posts within the limited moderation tools given to them by ActivityPub if they don't want that post to be fully public.

There are alternatives to social media for communicating to people when you don't want it to be public. Use those if you don't want to filter. I'm a firm believer that trusting users to monitor the content they wish to receive is the best default and the only time a platform should be blocked fully is when that platform has proven to be abusive.

## [You don't have to be a “content creator” to have a website](https://ohhelloana.blog/just-get-a-website/) by Ana Rodrigues

Ana Rodrigues is a firm believer that anyone can benefit from a personal website, not just people who create things for profit.

She also brings up the fact that a lot of people are brainwashed into thinking they need to monetize their hobbies due to social pressure or they have nothing of value to contribute. 

In reality we all have something worth sharing and not everything in life is about making money.

## [It’s not you. It’s me. (Taking a break from Mastodon)](https://vkc.sh/its-not-you-its-me-taking-a-break-from-mastodon/) by Veronica

Another post about Mastodon and social media in general. 

Veronica is the creator of the YouTube channel [Veronica Explains](https://www.youtube.com/@VeronicaExplains/videos) and has been an advocate of the fediverse, created education videos regarding open source software, and shares interesting projects that keep old systems alive.

In this post she shares why she is leaving Mastodon and the fediverse in general. The two major reasons is social media doesn't promote nuanced discursion, people become abusive for imaginary internet points, and the way Mastodon servers block content creates disjoined discussions.

This has always been the case with social media and unfortunately Mastodon has these issues just like the others. I think this along with Manton Reece's post really hit home on the issues the fediverse still needs to figure out. I personally don't think this is a problem that can be solved with technical solutions like bans and hiding content. The solution lies with a much needed culture shift, but that would be a article in itself.

In any case, check out Veronica's stuff.

## [Personal Web, Personal Sovereignty](https://starbreaker.org/blog/personal/personal-web-personal-sovereignty/index.html) by Starbreaker

Starbreaker wrote a post on how owning a website gives him freedom he can't get anywhere else. It is a great read and even inspired me to write [my own post](https://techtea.io/articles/2024/digital-sovereinty-personal-web-freedom/) about the subject. We even had a pleasant conversation over email.

He goes into how he is his own boss on his website, not beholden to anything other than US law, can write what he wants, code it using any tech he wants, and never has to worry about what others think. That is the true freedom of a personal website.

There is a lot of great parts I could quote here, but you should probably just read his post. 

Starbreaker's post was for [32-Bit Cafe's](https://32bit.cafe) one year [code jam](https://tilde.32bit.cafe/~hermit/community_jam_3/). If you want some more pro-personal web propaganda take a look at the other amazing entries.

## YouTube

YouTube is my default time waster and I've been trying to cut back on all that infotainment junk, but there are still a lot of good things on the platform.

### [On therapy, tigers and retirement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NS1H3hozE4w) by Adam Ragusea

Adam Ragusea is a popular person in the food and cooking space on YouTube. He recently went into simi-retirement and talks about the psychological burden of feeling comfortably well off and having class consciousness, the feeling of obligation to continue to work, and how beneficial therapy is.

He opens up talking about how we all neglect our psychological needs when we are struggling to find food, pay bills, and cover medical expenses. Once those needs are covered we start to realize how broken we are mentally and might be some guilt for trying to take care of it while others cannot even think about their psychological needs. 

Some interesting stuff there. On the bright side, he isn't trying to keep up with the unappeasable YouTube algorithm anymore. A lot of people who create stuff online feel the pull to continue to create to appease recommendation algorithms to pay bills. This destroys art, creativity, and eventually the creator of the stuff we enjoy consuming. 

The creator economy as it exists is not sustainable and while many people who are successful with it are far more financially stable than I am, I can't help but feel sad that they have to play the SEO game and throw away their passions to game the system.

### [why you should have a youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jr4G6bZILGQ) by Kuya Gian

On  more positive note, Kuya Gian talks about how empowering YouTube can be. He talks about how everyone has a story to tell, with the death of 3rd spaces it helps build community as a kind of 3rd space online, and how it helps one find their creative selves.

All of us have something we want to express. While metrics and algorithms kill creativity, community can nurture it. I do hope we see more creators who are not just seeking numbers and we see platforms that don't put metrics front and center.

### [How to not sell your soul to the internet: a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yT0r9IXxOxM) by lrnjulie

lrnjulie talks about the struggles people who create public facing work on the internet face with identity. 

She gives some good insight about how we present ourselves depending on who we are talking to, how we form our self-perception based on how we think the people we care about perceive us, and what we can do about it. 

Basically it boils down to not oversharing personal details, avoid parasocial relationships with our audiences, and categorize your relationship with your audience as acquaintances and not close friends.

I am in the process of making my blog a little more personal and less professional, but it is always good to remember to not get to caught up in what others think about you. Also avoid metrics, they kill creativity and soul like nothing else on the internet.

### [Building a DIY Surgical Robot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_8rHKrwr-Q) by Bennett Stirton

Bennett Stirton is working on reverse engineering a surgical robot. This video is a little light on technical details, but still an interesting watch.

Medical tech should be more open in general and people should have the ability to learn how it works if they are interested.

### [Saudi Arabia’s Secret Plan To Keep Us Hooked On Oil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aT0r_yJafmg) by Climate Town

Saudi Arabia pleged to lower their climate impact, but they also came up with a plan to make African and Asian nations dependent on oil to improve their profits. The best part, their plan was caught on camera thanks to journalists.

These countries are likely to suffer the most from global warming. 

Climate Town is a fairly popular YouTube channel that covers a lot of climate change news and is worth checking out. He gives a lot of useful information on what the issues we are facing as well as solutions to the problems.

### [The 3D Filament Tier List: Which Spools Rule?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weeG9yOp3i4) by Zack Freedman

Zack Freedman lists all the major 3D printer filaments and grades them on how useful and printable they are for home users.

Zack Freedman's videos are always filled with puns and a little bit of immature humor, but he also always has valuable insights to share regarding making things in general.

I highly recommend his channel to anyone interested in 3D printing, electronics, or cool projects. 

He also invented one of my favorite open source hardware projects, [Gridfinity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8). Definitely check that video out as well. 

### [Software Emulators vs FPGAs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMMiBEhnizE) by What's Ken Making

Software and video game preservation has been very difficult due to broken copyright laws and lack of funding, but both emulators and FPGAs have made great strides in saving games and software.

This video provides an excellent introduction to how older games and the tools used to play them work. I highly recommend it if you are curious about video game history, emulation, or retro/homebrew gaming.

### [How To Make Everything](https://www.youtube.com/makeeverythingtv/videos)

How To Make Everything is a YouTube channel focusing on making all sorts of things from scratch. They are on the larger side as far as YouTube channels go, but they seem to be creating a lot of amazing things.

If you ever been interested in history or just making things in general they are worth a watch.

### [Pellet Extruder for ANY 3D PRINTER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0rVNFXp9IA) by Greenboy3D

Greenboy3D showcases a supposedly affordable and efficient pellet extruder for FDM 3D printing he designed. 

Normally 3D printers use rolls of filament made from plastic to create objects. A pellet extruder used plastic pellets instead.

Not only is this cheaper, but it gives people an easier way to recycle plastic and mix in additives on the fly.

The main problem is most pellet extruders are expensive and not very easy to work with.

Greenboy3D says he has fixed a lot of those issues and if true that is very impressive. Unfortunately he did not link to any files or product pages for this extruder in the video description. When he does I will be looking into it.

### [Programmer's Worst Problem in 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKqqU1J-WXk) by Internet of Bugs

Internet of Bugs talks his theory on why software engineering and the tech sector in general are suffering.

It boils down to a lack of consequences for companies. He uses Microsoft for example; despite many security flaws, bugs, and exploits caused by limited oversight and poor quality control they have been rewarded with becoming the worlds most valuable company and the decision makers that brought about these problems were rewarded with large bonuses while their engineers were layed off.

We need to remind companies that they don't own their customers, their obligation is to their customers and not their shareholders, and that there are real consequences for bad behavior. 

Imagine if Nestle's executives were punished for their use of slave labor or oil companies were forced to pay for the lives they took. These companies would be far less likely to behave as they do now.

We need to stand up to these companies, put pressure on politicians for positive change, and create real consequences for bad behavior. Also tech workers need to unionize.

### [How I broadcast LoRa packets WITHOUT a radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIdHBDSQHyw) by CNLohr

This is an interesting project that is a bit over my head. Basically CNLohr used microcontrollers without radios to send LoRa radio signals up to 1km. 

It is crazy how that is possible, especially considering LoRa is a closed source tech so it had to be done via reverse engineering. Really cools stuff.

### [All the Ways Car Dependency Is Wrecking Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kSTJnT0tUE) by CityNerd

CityNerd is a snarky and fun Urbanist YouTuber who covers a lot of issues related to walkability, car related issues, and just silly city related videos in general.

The danger of cars has been well documented. They are the cause of many deaths both directly and indirectly, isolate us, make walking more difficult, take away our independence, drain our wallets, etc. Very few people can argue against that even if we only present anecdotal evidence of these things because we all experience their effects every day.

Just in case someone wants to argue though, CityNerd covers the information in this [research paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966692324000267#bb0390). I link to the video instead of the paper in the heading because a lot of people are more inclined to watch a video than read a paper.

If you want more motivation to stand up against car dependent infrastructure take a look at StrongTown's [Can The Government Turn Your Home Into a Highway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_nLd1TdUC8). I'm living in Los Angeles, CA I know that induced demand is a real issue and expanding Freeways only displaces people, creates more traffic, and causes physical and economic harm for everyone involved. There are few reasons to expand freeways that are ethically motivated given all the evidence. It is a waste of taxpayer dollars.

Also check out West China Tea's video announcing the [closure of their physical location](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0D0Ntc3E1EE) due to the expansion of the I-35 in Austin, TX. I've not been to Texas myself, but as I said above, LA suffers from car centric infrastructure.

As a side note, West China Tea has a [website](https://westchinatea.com) where you can get great Chinese teas and a series of videos on their YouTube channel covering [chinese tea culture and brewing practices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OZ_7sfEf9-8&list=PLgnB2QJGjqNqTfmcP4X57GUuWyB4NSDLO&pp=iAQB).
