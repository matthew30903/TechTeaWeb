description: Big tech tried to kill web surfing and independent websites. Fortunately they failed. Lets find out how to surf the IndieWeb.

One of the things people often talk about is how the old web felt bigger and was fun to explore compared to the modern internet. Even though there are more websites than every it feels like there are only a few big ones, web surfing is dead, and that the web in general is a hostile place. While it is true that on ad driven search engines AI slop and SEO spam make up a large amount of results, there are still many interesting websites out there if you know how to find them. Today we are going to make surfing the web fun again. 

## Beautiful Places on the Net and How to Find Them

There are a lot of wonderful places on the web, but social media algorithms and SEO spam have long since hidden most of them from the view of the average person. I'd like to think that some people will try searching for something outside social media and the first page on their search engine once they know it is possible. That is why we are going to talk about some of the discover mechanisms I've found over time.

### Search Engines

Most major search engines are not very useful for finding anything outside of big websites and AI generated garbage, but there are some small ones that stand out. 

[Marginalia](https://search.marginalia.nu) - Marginalia is designed to find the smaller websites you didn't know existed. From what the site says and from my own experience it is best to treat it like a plain text search engine. What you type is what you get unlike major search engines that modify your search in the background and infer intent. While it is biased towards smaller sites you can still find some larger sites like Wikipedia in its index. 

[Stract](https://stract.com) - This is an interesting one. Stract is a search engine that lets you customize the search results. This means you can help bias it towards or against particular websites, create complex filters, etc. It is still in beta, but the results seem to be decent and the feature set sounds promising on paper. They have been given a grant to help their project and plan to monetize with ads that they claim will be clearly labeled and non-tracking. They also have a plan for a ad free subscription. I'm not inherently against that as long as the ads cannot be mistaken for search results like what Google does. Ads and search engines are naturally incompatible with each other's mission so it can be a danger if they become desperate for income in the future.

[Mwmbl](https://mwmbl.org) - This is a non-profit search engine that aims to actually compete with for profit engines like Google. They have their own indexer that is run by volunteers. You can even run the indexer on your own computer if you want to contribute. They are still small, but have large goals of indexing large parts of the internet. My only concern about it is that they could end up flooded with AI generated slop just like the bigger engines. We will see how it goes in a few years.

[Kagi](https://kagi.com) - This is a smaller commercial search engine that seems to be popular and that popularity is why I must mention it. They are private by default and make money from a subscription. I have nothing against that personally. What I do have a problem with is that they have drank the generative AI Kool-Aid. They offer LLMs for summarization and for general information engine features. I can't support that considering all the great things AI has done for us already. They do support smaller/indie websites over large and AI Generated ones and seem to be more mindful of the AI features they do have. I just don't think generative AI trained on data you don't own is a good thing. 

### Independent Web Communities

The ever increasing contempt for the commercial web has spawned many small communities around making independent websites and making the web better overall. These online communities generally favor forums over social media and closed chat platforms, making them perfect resources for finding new things as well as making your own.

The [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) is a community of webmasters that want to control their online lives from their personal website, but also have ways to connect to the closed source and corporate web. Their website is a wiki where they brainstorm ideas and technologies to help facilitate that idea. They also host activities to help independent website owners connect with each other. They have a [chat](https://chat.indieweb.org/) for talking with their community, the [IndieWeb Carnival](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Carnival) where people can find monthly blog prompts and also find new blogs to read, and a [movie club](https://indieweb.org/IndieWeb_Movie_Club) with a similar idea. 

[32bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe) has a less tech focused feel than the IndieWeb, but still has the goal of helping people come together and build awesome stuff on the web. They are focused on websites as a way to express oneself creatively and connect with others. They provide comprehensive guides on making websites, a [forum](https://discourse.32bit.cafe) full of people sharing ideas and websites, and a general more accessible vibe for people looking to get started building websites. Like the IndieWeb they host events to help encourage blogging or creating webpages in general in the form of code jams. 

[MelonLand Forum](https://forum.melonland.net) is digital art community that I don't have too much experience with, but they are big on the web revival movement. Melon's own [website](https://melonking.net/melon?z=/home) is an amazing fever dream of what the web could be without the profit motive and capitalistic drive for endless growth.

[NeoCities](https://neocities.org) is a web hosting company that provides free and affordable static site hosting. They are similar to the old [GeoCities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeoCities) before Yahoo took the service down. Unlike most "free" hosting providers NeoCities has no ads and the free tier is funded by the people who do pay the $5/month hosting fee for extra features. They have a [web directory](https://neocities.org/browse) of most of the sites they host, making it a great place to find more interesting websites.

There are many more communities that I'm not familiar with, but if you know of them please let me know and I'll add them after checking them out.

### Links on Independent Websites and Web Directories

This might be obvious, but a lot of websites link to other websites in articles, blogrolls, button walls, and webrings. If you run a website try linking to other websites and if you are on a person's personal website try following those links. 

I do a [monthly favorites](/tags/monthly-favorites/) posts where I link to other people's interesting creations, sometimes with commentary. 

Frills's has a [bookmarks page](https://frills.dev/bookmarks/) she frequently updates that always has fun links. She also has a [button wall](https://frills.dev/links/) where she links to other websites.

MelonLand has a webring/directory called [MellonLand Surf Club](https://melonland.net/surf-club) that links to the websites of the members of the MelonLand forum.

The IndieWeb Wiki has a page dedicated to [webrings](https://indieweb.org/webring) and [blogrolls](https://indieweb.org/blogroll).

32bit Cafe has an [article](https://32bit.cafe/interactingontheweb/) with many examples of how website owners interact with one another on the web to help bring people together. You will find some links to web pages with links on them. 

[Derek Sivers](https://sive.rs) has a [web directory](https://nownownow.com) of people who have /now pages on their websites. There are a lot of web directories/web rings based on the concept of showing off a single page on a website like this.

There are web directories like [List-Me](https://list-me.com), [ooh.directory](https://ooh.directory), and [LinkLane](https://linklane.net/index.php) that provide categorized links to websites. Web directories like this are a great way to find new websites about specific topics.

Links like this encourage organic discovery and are one of the core features of the web. Not only does it encourage web surfing, it literally makes the web a web. 

## Why do Any of This?

Most *normal* people probably don't see a reason for all this, there is social media and there is search for everything else. Deliberately searching for things to consume is a thing of the past for many people, it is time consuming, not tailored to the individual, and sometimes there will be a wall without anything else to consume. The thing is, I thing the web should be more like this.

When you have to hunt for things and are not being bombarded with content from all sides you can be more mindful about what you do consume. Discovering new things to enjoy is a process, but often a rewarding one. Participating in the web like this instead of on corporate run social media helps make the internet more resilient, censorship resistant, and helps us fight algorithm generated echo chambers. 

The independent web has more room for nuance, true communication, and creative freedom than any attention draining corporate platform will ever allow to become popular. There are exceptions with amazing YouTube channels, people posting insightful stuff on social media, and the like, but they are the exceptions and not the rule. 

There is an alternative internet to the money driven techbro dystopia we see in many popular websites. The problem is most people don't know it exists or how to access it.

## Concerns about Safety

People have been trained to be afraid of websites they don't recognize. The good news is that modern computers and web browsers are more resilient than they were in the past and most people on the independent web are not out to scam you. Follow good practices like using an ad/content blocker like uBlock Origin, don't sign into a website you don't trust with login information, if their site starts bombarding you with popups or asks for permissions leave, etc. 

All that is to say, be smart and your web surfing will not hurt you or your computer.

## This is a Living Article

This is a living article/resource about discovery on the non-corporate web. If you have suggestions, corrections, or general comments that you think will help this article out please let me know.

Eventually I want this to be a resource for everyone who wants to find new things on the web or gather ideas on how to add more connectivity to their own website.
