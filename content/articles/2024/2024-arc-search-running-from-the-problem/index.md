description: I've read a lot about generative AI lately and it looks like we are using it to create more problems than do good.
---

If we are to believe the headlines, AI is the future that will save us all from every ailment in existence. While there is value in things like computer vision and generative AI for summarizing information, it is not a silver bullet for our problems.

Im my January [Favorite Things post](https://techtea.io/articles/2024/jan-favs/) I mentioned Jim Nielsen's [post](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/treating-the-symptoms/) about Arc Search and how he mentioned it was like treating the symptoms. Turns out [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/a-rant-on-arc-search) also wrote a post as well about the subject.

Basically it is an AI that searches the web for you, summarizes the content of those websites, and spits that info back at you. There are many problems with this, but Jim and Manuel go over the specifics far better than I could articulate. 

While I have an issue with Arc Search specifically, I have even more issues with the idea that AI can solve human problems.

## AI is a Scam

When I say AI is a scam, I don't mean all or even most of it. I mean the generative technologies that are being marketed as replacements for human experiences are a scam.

Like crypto, AI is mostly hype from media companies trying to get clicks. They don't know how it works or why the tech is cool, neither do the venture capitalists throwing money at AI startups. The consumers using generative AI tools like GPT have no clue how they work and generally don't care as long as it can give them answers. Even lawyers have been lazily using AI in courtrooms, to [disastrous results](https://www.reuters.com/legal/new-york-lawyers-sanctioned-using-fake-chatgpt-cases-legal-brief-2023-06-22/). 

AI cannot replace [customer service jobs](https://www.washingtonpost.com/travel/2024/02/18/air-canada-airline-chatbot-ruling/), artists, or writers. Why? Because these jobs require creativity and empathy that deep learning cannot ever develop. In an attempt to remove the human element in creativity we are left with soulless images and articles made only with the intent of creating value for share holders.

Arc Search is speeding up the removal of the human element from the internet. It removes incentive for writers to create content, distances the reader from putting deep thought into the content they are consuming, and eventually leads to a world where there is more brain dead AI content on the internet being used to train more AI.

## What can we do about it?

For one, we can call out AI for stealing our creations. Cat GPT, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion have all committed mass copyright infringement against all of mankind. We should continue to fight against the propaganda that companies like [Disney](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/08/08/disney-reportedly-creates-task-force-to-explore-ai-and-cut-costs.html) are putting out there to make AI replacing artists sound like a good thing.

We can also create things of value for others. Manuel and Jim both speak of something very concerning, the idea that AI can remove the motivation for people to create things on the web. They are right to an extent. If everything I give away for free is going to be stollen by a mega corp and then sold to their customers I'd be discouraged too. That said, the only way to fight back against AI generated slop is to create things of our own. We can create our own spaces outside of the corporate web where we can create and find meaningful content. I feel like that is what the IndieWeb and Small Web movements have been heading towards, an environment outside the corporate world.

Also we can educate ourselves about AI. Not all of it is bad and knowing how it works means we can identify ways to [disrupt unjust data collection](https://www.theverge.com/24063327/ai-art-protect-images-copyright-generators), make it useful for our personal projects, and generally have fun with it.

I love playing around with LLMs on my computer for fun. Same with Stable Diffusion for generating images. I see no problems with generative AI for non-commercial uses. I can also see it being useful for automating repetitive tasks that honestly don't contribute to the human experience.

## Not All AI is Bad

While I thing generative AI is generally a bad thing outside of playing around, there are many other types of AI being used that can help solve problems in our world.

It could help us detect [issues missed by doctors](https://www.rsna.org/news/2022/march/AI-Helps-Detect-Bone-Fractures), help us scan our notes with OCR, [detect what books we have on our bookshelves](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/22/photo-bookshelf/), and [improve prosthetic limbs](https://www.wevolver.com/article/how-ai-is-helping-power-next-generation-prosthetic-limbs).

AI can and will be used for bad things, but there are many uses for this tech that help improve human lives rather than reduce them. 

## A last note about Arc Search

Don't use Arc Search. Look for information using search engines that respect you, talk to your friends, and check out the many blogs, websites, and youtube channels I link to in my [Monthly Favorites](http://techtea.io/tags/monthly-favorites/). 

AI can be useful, but we should not let it do our thinking for us nor should we let it take away the human connection we have with each other. Lets create a better web by actually creating it rather than hiding the problems the corporate internet has behind black box AI and algorithms.
