description: I've read and watched a lot of stuff this month. Let's discuss some of my favorite ones.
---

Lots of fun stuff this month. I really need to start that link blog so these posts are shorter.

## Cool Projects

So there are a lot of cool projects out there and I will probably forget about the ones I haven't had a chance to play with if I don't bookmark them. I may as well share them with you as well.

### [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org)

Newsboat is a terminal based RSS/Atom feed reader.

I've been using NextCloud News for handling my RSS feeds, but the web UI broke during an upgrade so I've been playing around with some desktop clients. NextCloud news is still working and syncing so I wanted a client that could work with my server. 

I tried RSS guard, but its UI crashed on me and I couldn't get the filter list to work. Tunderbird doesn't sync with outside services and is just a client. The other RSS readers that supported NextCloud News were buggy on Wayland. That left Newsboat.

Newsboat is amazing. I will probably write an article about it soon. It is fast, customizable, and because it works in the terminal it can integrate with almost any tool. I have it synced to my NextCloud now and articles update between my phone and computer perfectly.

### [DeArrow](https://dearrow.ajay.app)

DeArrow removes clickbait titles and thumbnails from YouTube. It is an amazing idea. Instead of using videographer provided information it crowedsources the titles and takes a random shot from the video to use as a thumbnail. I've been using it for a while and the titles are hit and miss, but for the most part are fairly good.

If you hate clickbait that doesn't tell you anything about the video you are about to watch it is a worth while thing to look at.

## Blogs

Blogs and personal websites are probably the best places to find insightful and interesting content nowadays. There are many other types of interesting website, but blogs are probably the most human. Here are some of the highlights of this month. Feel free to send me links to your blog or other ones you think are interesting.

### [The Web is Fantastic](https://rknight.me/blog/the-web-is-fantastic/) by Robert Knight

Links are what make finding interesting things on the internet possible. Social media has tried to kill that along with everything else, but fortunately the personal web has helped reverse that trend.

Robert Knight writes a wonderful manifesto of sorts about linking, creating, and discovering the personal web. It includes a lot of links to other places on the internet in case I don't have enough to share here.

### [The web is not dying](https://manuelmoreale.com/the-web-is-not-dying) by Manuel Moreale

Manu writes a post full of hope for the internet. I agree with him here, the web is getting better each day.

With blogs, web directories, and sustainable web services we are seeing a resurgence in the web as a decentralized and open platform.

### [Inconsistency is a feature, not a bug](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/04/inconsistency-is-a-feature-not-a-bug/) by Terence Eden

Terence Eden talks about how icons used to be distinct and fun, but a lot of them are soulless and indistinguishable from one another.

I have to agree for a large part. There is nothing wrong with having simple icons or a brand identity, but when you look back at older iconography you can see creativity. Many of us have high resolution displays nowadays so icons can afford to be a little more distinct.

### [How bad are search results? Let's compare...](https://danluu.com/seo-spam/) by Dan Luu

We all know search engines suck nowadays. Part of it is because there is too much to index for a general purpose search engine, part is because AI generated garbage pollute the net, part is due to SEO spam created by humans, and part of it is because search engines got greedy. 

That said, some search engines might be better than others and Dan Luu has done some research on this. This is a long post, but the conclusion is that the normal computer user (not using an adblocker and not knowing how to use search modifiers) would have a hard time actually finding anything of depth with most search engines. Some (like Google) even outright highlight scams over real results.

It is a bit depressing, but I think we are going to see a resurgence in human curation in the near future. At least in the small/personal web space. Be this search engines, web directories, or smaller search engines. I think the future can be bright if we make it. One thing is certain, Google's search engine Dominance is not going to last.

### [The Man Who Killed Google Search](https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/) by Edward Zitron

Edward Zitron tells the story of how Prabhakar Ragahavan and Sundar Pichai destroyed Google Search by chasing endless growth.

Ragahaven is in charge of Google's search products after they pivoted from a search tool to an ad spam platform. The result of seeking this unsustainable growth was poor and dangerous search results, bad PR, the laying off of many employees, and the removal of people who actually cared about more than numbers going up. Google was profitable before, they didn't need to destroy the internet to stay that way, but they got greedy and broke the search engine that made them rich in the first place.

As Edward Zitron put it:

> This is the result of taking technology out of the hands of real builders and handing it to managers at a time when “management” is synonymous with “staying as far away from actual work as possible.” And when you’re a do-nothing looking to profit as much as possible, you only care about growth. You’re not a user, you’re a parasite, and it’s these parasites that have dominated and are draining the tech industry of its value.

It is the overly capitalistic growth cultists that will destroy the world and have you thank them for it. We can't continue to let this happen.

### [Verify you’re a human before visiting](https://rubenerd.com/verify-youre-a-human-before-visiting/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade encounters CAPTCHAs far too often and has had enough. 

At one point they helped prevent DDoS attacks and limit bad traffic to websites, but nowadays the only use for a CAPTCHA is to annoy potential human visitors and prevent people from accessing the website.

Computers have gotten to the point where they can solve CAPTCHAs better than humans. In response companies have made them so difficult or annoying to complete that they can only be solved by a computer.

I'm with him on this one. If I see too many of these I'm not visiting your site, my time is worth far more than your content is worth if I have to fight just to view it.

### [The Sour Taste of Entitlement](https://quickfix.es/2024/04/the-sour-taste-of-entitlement/) by Paul Brown

Paul Brown tells the story of Jo, someone who complains about getting free food that is not to his tastes.

Unfortunately this entitlement is all too common in the world. You give someone something for free and they will act like you owe them for taking it.

The open source community has seen far too much of this and it is starting to wear maintainers thin. If there is an open source project you use and it doesn't work exactly how you want it to then contribute your time to adding the feature, discussing why it is useful, or maybe donate some money to the project. People don't have to give you the fruits of their labor, they do so because they want to.

No one owes you anything, be kind.

### [Use your Tools](https://boffosocko.com/2024/03/08/use-your-tools/) by Chris Aldrich

Chris Aldrich runs an interesting website. It is a digital Zettelkasten with many ideas, quotes, and just about anything else he can take an catalogue.

In this short post he mentions that tools are useless if they are not used. 

I agree and just wanted to share his site. It is not a site I frequent, but the concept of using the web as a public repository of all your accumulated information and knowledge is interesting.

### [You Are What You Read, Even If You Don’t Always Remember It](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2024/you-are-what-you-read/) by Jim Nielsen 

Jim Nielsen posted a note he took from Dave Rupert's post [How do you verify that?](https://daverupert.com/2024/03/lies-damned-lies-and-stochastics/). Even when you don't remember what you consumed, it sticks with you.

This is both a good thing and a bad thing. On one end we benefit from consuming good information even passively, on the other hand there is a lot of garbage that can give us unconscious biases that warp our world view.

This is one of the reasons I've been making these monthly posts by the way, it helps bring intention to otherwise passive consumption.

### [A thread about people who need to run Windows](https://rubenerd.com/people-who-need-to-run-windows/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade made the mistake of pointing out the obvious to a bunch of Linux zealots. He points out that unfortunately many people require Windows. They need it for work, school, or some other activity. While WINE and Proton have greatly reduced the gap between Windows and Linux, there are still some people who cannot leave.

That got a lot of amusing responses from people who clearly lack self-awareness. Windows is an abusive operating system and like many forms of abuse people suffering from it aren't always able to escape from the situation, otherwise they wouldn't be there in the first place.

Microsoft still has a large market share of the desktop and business world. Till that market share declines significantly they will continue to shove tracking, ads, and unethical AI down their user's throats and ask that they thank them for it.

Windows users have the same right to complain about Windows as workers have about their jobs. Many people aren't in a position to quit their minimum wage jobs to find a fair job with a union. Same for many Windows users.

That said, if you are stuck using a Windows or Mac device for your daily computing I do recommend trying out Linux or BSD. It takes a different mindset and it is still not there for everyone, but it is worth it if you value freedom and privacy. 

### [No, AI won’t solve burnout!](https://rubenerd.com/no-ai-wont-solve-burnout/) also by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade has been on a roll this month with good posts.

I do think there are some places where deep learning tools will be useful, but they will not solve burnout. Like I've said before in my post about Arc Search, we need human solutions for human problems. If you say AI will solve burnout you are either ignorant of what has happened to the working class over the last 100 years or you are a liar. 

### [Lessons Learned From the liblzma and xz Backdoor](https://trafotin.com/v/xz-backdoor/) by Trafotin

There was a backdoor in the open source xz library that made headlines. The malicious code didn't get a chance to effect most systems and was caught by someone doing performance benchmarks on SSH.

This library was used by many open source and proprietary projects. Most probably didn't even know they were using xz and none offered to help the volunteer who was making this tool as a hobby when they started feeling burned out.

This allowed a malicious actor social engineer their way into becoming a maintainer of the project, where they slowly injected the backdoor.

The good news it it was caught and the attack targeted prebuilt binaries and not the source code. It was also highly targeted. As long as your OS was using their own builds and not the binaries they would likely never be effected.

One misconception about this is that the issue would only impact Linux if it got into the wild. This library could have been deployed on Windows, Mac, BSD, Android, and who knows where else. Then again, most systems do not deploy the newest software as soon as it comes out so it would have taken a while.

In any case, this attack both showcases how FOSS software helps prevent these attacks (imagine if it was closed source so no one could find out about it) and also that we need to support the projects we use (if the maintainer had other volunteers, people moderating abusive comments, and financial support from the corporations that use their work this issue would likely never have happened).

### [Self Checkout](https://blog.jpnearl.com/2024/04/21/self-checkout/) by J.P.

J.P. talks about the horrors of modern retail shopping. Self checkout has been annoying for everyone involved. Customers are forced to do the work employees once had to do, machines are often broken, and less people get hired to maintain a functioning store.

The problems with self checkout are well documented, but give J.P.'s blog a read. 

### [Sermon](https://www.zinzy.website/2023/11/05/sermon/) by Zinzy Waleson Geene

This is an old post, but I just found this blog.

Zinzy Waleson Geene shares a sermon where she expresses thoughts on how storytelling can hide details and storytellers have the power to distort facts. She also talks about the impossible task of living up to the stories of perfect saints.

I'm not Catholic, but I think we are all surrounded with stories of how great or evil some abstract person, place, or thing is without really knowing it. Without nuance we are all missing something.

One paragraph from the post that really stood out to me and the reason for me including it on this list was this:

> I struggle with saints, with how our tradition has curated, abstracted their human realities. I struggle with the fact that this is an effect of storytelling at all. I struggle with what happens when details go missing, when nuance is lost. I struggle with how, without details and nuance, we idealize as quickly as we devalue. The absence of details turn excellent Harry Potter books into pretty ok Harry Potter movies. It turns Mary Teresa, a sweet, charitable nun with questionable opinions on the realities of sexual violence in the Catholic church, into the pinnacle of female selflessness. It turns inhabitants of Gaza into terrorists. It turns Judaism into the root of all evil.

We need to be extra carful to not generalize when talking about others or we risk losing our humanity and bend to storyteller's wills. This is why so many have fallen to conspiracy theories, defend criminal politicians ability to run for U.S. president, and spread hate on social media. We should always be mindful of the stories we hear and tell so we can be better human beings.

## YouTube

YouTube is my default time waster and I've been trying to cut back on all that infotainment junk, but there are still a lot of good things on the platform.

### [YouTube sucks now. Here's how to fix it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rteYHxcLCZk) by Eric Murphy

Anyone who has used YouTube in its earlier days knows that YouTube used to be a lot better. There was less clickbate, no shorts, a way to know what videos were of low quality, less intrusive and harmful ads, etc. Eric Murphy agrees and shares a list of browser extensions that help mitigate YouTube's bad decisions.

Take a look and see if you find anything helpful. 

### [Disney+ : Where Anime Goes to Die](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQe6z02M9OY&t=414s) by Mother's Basement

Geoff Thew from Mother's Basement talks about Disney's neglect for the properties they own the license for. 

Western anime publishers have been going through a rough time lately as they try to cut every expense and keep their numbers going up. Disney however hasn't even tried to advertise the series they publish so anime on their platform largely doesn't get seen by people and thus gets low ratings. 

In a world where Hollywood can't see art as anything more than a cynical cash grab this leads to a lot of shows just fading into nothing. Geoff goes over some of his favorite anime published in the west by Disney and laments the lack of care the company has for anything that shows artistic promise.

As someone who loves anime as a medium it huts to see companies treat it, and all art for that matter, as a liability or something that can help their stock prices. When the entrainment industry lives only for profit there is no room for art or human expression. Disney's neglect is likely a symptom of their recent fear of animation as a medium and this cynical endless growth mentality. 

### [Real-life AIM-ASSIST: Aimbot V3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miRnNy7ZvIc) by Excessive Overkill

Computer vision has always been interesting to me and this is an interesting project implementing it. 

Basically Excessive Overkill made an airsoft gun that can auto aim and track targets.

I do find the idea of auto aiming guns worrisome, but nevertheless it is an amazing and fun project.

### [What ACTUALLY happens during a Stack Overflow?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6zAAhkU_Iw) by LaurieWired

LaurieWired demonstrates how a Stack Overflow works. If you have ever been curious about how it works and want a visualization her video does a good job.

Her channel is about reverse engineering and cybersecurity. Highly recommend people check it out, also there is a Serial Experiments Lain theme going on with her videos, that is always a plus.

### [I made custom 3D printing filament with my Logo inside!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQ-N1fr4N0w) by CNC Kitchen

Stefan from CNC Kitchen uses his [Recreator3D](http://recreator3d.com) to resize filament. Normally the Recreator3D is used to turn PET bottles into filament, but it can be used to resize any thermal plastic into 3d printer filament.

In this video he 3d prints multi-material strips on his 3d printer and then uses the Recreator3D to  turn them into standard size filament. This means he can put custom designs, mix materials, and use multiple colors in one filament. The process is not perfect, but it definitely shows some amazing potential. 

### [The END of CENTOS matters more than you think!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mfsjSuE0kSs) by The Linux Experiment

Nick from The Linux Experiment interviews Joao Correia from TuxCare regarding CentOS's end of life and what it means for the community and enterprise users alike.

While this is an ad for TuxCare it is full of insight into the issues that CentOS's EOL present for everyone. 

For those of you who don't know, CentOS was basically a FOSS version of RedHat Enterprise Linux. Many people would use it to create competitors to RedHat or just use it in place of RedHat. This lead IBM/RedHat to remove access to RedHat's source code and switching CentOS from being a clone of RedHat to being a rolling release upstream to RedHat. This made it unsuitable for servers and business use and left many without a migration path. TuxCare is one of the companies providing extended support for CentOS users so they can find a migration path.

### [Building a Bimetallic Tea Monitoring Mechanism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJzy1vk2zyc) by Chronova Engineering

This is one of those projects that really makes me wish I studied engineering and had metal working equipment. 

Chronova Engineering makes mechanical device that detects when his tea is at the right temperature. It does this using the thermal expansion of a metal rod he places in the drink. As the drink cools the rod moves into the right spot and triggers a ball to fall onto a bell.

I am always amazed at the kinds of things people come up with.
