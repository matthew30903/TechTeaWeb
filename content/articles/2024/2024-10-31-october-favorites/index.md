description: I've read and watched a lot of stuff this month. Here are the highlights. I hope you find something you didn't know about before.
---

I may or may not have fallen into a retro computing and camera (videography and photography both) rabbithole this month.

Also it is election season in the United States and this year we have a wannabe dictator trying to make it as hard as possible for people to vote so there has been some coverage about that as well. If you haven't already voted yet and are a U.S. voter please do so because this year will be a close one. If you aren't interested in US politics you probably won't care about some of the entries on this list, but hey there is talk about videogames and the web on the list so maybe stick around.

It has been a busy month overall with work and personal life so I've not written as much as I'd have liked and I've got a bit of an idea backlog building up. 

## Books

### The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas by Ursula K. Le Guin

This is a work of short philosophical fiction where Le Guin describes the utopian city of Omelas. She asks the reader to imagine the most perfect city imaginable and then reveals that Omelas has a dark open secret. A child is locked away in a dark room in one of the houses in Omelas. They are subject to every manner of neglect. When people come of age in Omelas they are shown the child and told that the suffering of this child makes their happiness possible, if the child was removed Omelas' splendor would fade. Every so often someone will have had enough and will walk away from the city in the dead of night, never to be seen again.

Le Guin keeps things purposely vague as she wants to get people thinking. I originally wrote a post full of my thoughts on this, but it came out far too political and melodramatic for my little blog here. I may share it once I've cleaned it up if there is interest. 

It is a good read that will not take much of your time to complete, but also poses some great questions that are worth thinking on. It is also a work with a lot of cultural relevance that has been referenced and responded to across media since it was written so you probably seen something related to it before.

## Articles

### [Web tech needs diversity](https://rubenerd.com/web-tech-needs-diversity/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben laments the lack of diversity in the tech ecosystem and how it is not only boring, but also a security risk.

There are a lot of factors that lead to the consolidation and lack of competition in tech. Lack of tech literacy, the march of endless growth under capitalism, people just wanting the simplest option, lack of funding and interest, etc.

Crowdstrike was just the most recent news worthy example of this issue. We need to break up monopolies, encourage competition, and create a world where people can tinker with tech for fun in a sustainable way. We also need open standards that are well documented so people can create their own implementations of said standards.

### [The Perfect Webpage](https://www.theverge.com/c/23998379/google-search-seo-algorithm-webpage-optimization) by Mia Sato, The Verge

This is an old one, but somehow I missed it.

Mia Sato wrote an article for the verge about how Google and SEO made all websites the same. 

A lot of people on the personal and less corporate web know how over zealous SEO kills creativity, harms users, and sucks the soul out of the internet. Unfortunately larger publishers need to make money and they can't do that without Google pushing traffic to their websites. Google keeps its exact rules for web ranking secret, but people are always working to game the system and generally google prefers a specific style of writing, specific website layouts, etc. 

This encourages soulless fluff over real human connection and useful information. Mia Sato even admits to having to play the SEO game for some articles at The Verge, otherwise the article wouldn't be seen. 

> It's hard to overstate how important Google traffic has become for publishers.
> These incentives are how we've ended up with a web full of content farms instead of diverse and interesting sites.

The disheartening thing about this whole thing is that even if Google falls from search dominance there will be some social media company or AI answer engine ready to take its place and make the world a worse place.

I'm glad there are other [discovery mechanisms](/articles/2024/surfing-independent-web/) out there for people who want to search for small creators, but in a sea of never ending AI and SEO spam it is getting harder for people who don't know how to find things to find them.

### [Email Superpowers](https://www.justuseemail.com/email-superpowers/) by Lawrence

Lawrence has a website dedicated to using email. I don't agree with everything posted here, but he has an excellent series of articles regarding why email is probably the best for your digital communication. He highlights the areas that messaging services have fallen short on and where email more than delivers.

I agree that email is probably best when it comes to decentralized communication. Unfortunately most people have a lot of misunderstandings about email or don't know how to get the most out of it. This has lead to a lot of people thinking email is bad and unusable for anything other than making accounts for websites. Hopefully his articles help guide people towards sending more emails.

### [Creation and Curation](https://manuelmoreale.com/creation-and-curation) by Manuel Moreale

Manuel wrote a short reminder to support people who create and curate things in this world full of AI slop. If we want a world of meaningful art and information we will need to fight for it.

### [Follow up on my “optics matter” post](https://rubenerd.com/follow-up-on-my-optics-matter-post/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade has another comment on the WordPress drama going on and about people in general. Everyone make mistakes and what separates people from being mature and rude is the ability to apologize for them. Some will excuse bad or inappropriate behavior on any number of things, but at the end of the day, if you have been told you made a mistake, apologize.

In the WordPress situation specifically there should have been a PR person handling the situation, not a developer who is blind by passion. I agree that private equity and venture capital is a blight on open source, as they are on everything else, but harming users in the process will never endear them to you. 

### [The story behind the Oblivion mod Terry Pratchett worked on](https://www.eurogamer.net/the-story-behind-the-oblivion-mod-terry-pratchett-worked-on) by Cian Maher via Eurogamer

Found this one randomly via the YouTube channel ShadesOfSlay's [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBI4GmshqZE) covering it.

The author Tarry Pratchett worked with Emma, one of the most famous modders for the Elder Scrolls series of video games, on one of the most famous Oblivion mods, [Vilja](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/28977).

The story is really sweet and thought it would be worth sharing. 

Pratchett was known for being a fan of video games and non-combat mods for Oblivion so it is believable that he would have worked on one of the best written companions for the game.

For those who play Skyrim a [similar mod was made](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6722) that improves on the base one. Though I don't subject my friends to playing Skyrim.

### [Should You Specialize In One Dev Stack?](https://brainbaking.com/post/2024/10/should-you-specialize-in-one-dev-stack/) by Wouter Groeneveld

Wouter Groeneveld discusses specialization again. He mentions something that is very relatable:

> I guess the core of the underlying problem then slowly reveals itself: I get (too?) quickly bored. I like learning new things. I always think the grass is greener on the other side. In the beginning, it really is—thanks to the temporary rose-tinted glasses subconsciously employed to inspect the new and exciting.

I don't know exactly how it is for him, but specialization in one thing and one thing only sounds like death to my soul. Hyper specialization is death, but it is good to have a deep understanding of a few things too. I feel like 90% of the time that someone is looking for a specialist, they really just need someone who is competent. Naturally I don't think one should commit to a task for others that requires knowledge far outside of what you already know, but I also don't think anyone should limit themselves to any one thing. Side projects and hobbies are great for experimenting and learning.

Then again, I'm not a developer anymore, outside of a few side projects so what do I know? 

### [Yey USA!](https://crys.site/blog/2024/usa-big-tech/) by Michał Sapka

Michał Sapka mentions some major wins in the U.S. that bring immense joy. Right to ownership got a win after California passed a law that forces companies to mention that digital items are not bought, instead they are leased. There is also the talk about breaking up Google, another beautiful thing. 

### [We own our own home!](https://rubenerd.com/we-own-our-own-home/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben and Clara just got a new apartment in Sydney. That is awesome.

I've been looking into buying a home one day and it looks to be an ever more distant goal with housing prices being what they are in the U.S. and in California especially, I can only imagine it is worse in Sydney. The logistics of moving and buying a place are crazy.

### [Should Cities Ban Drive Thrus?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vuXyG5gcA_M) by City Beautiful

City Beautiful talks about and makes a good case for drive thru bans.

I don't know how it is in the rest of the world, but I can say drive thrus are often more of a hinderance in southern Califorina than they are helpful. Occasionally they save a person a couple minutes, but often popular restaurants will have drive thru lines that spill onto the streets and they take away from valuable dine in space.

This is less of an issue in sparely populated areas, but even in rural areas a popular restaurant can cause a traffic jam at rush hour.

City Beautiful talks about how cities banning drive thrus has improved lives in areas that have banned them, highlights the way drive thrus take away space for other things like 3rd places, and how they are harmful for our health and planet. 

### [Why Tech Won't Save Us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lV6JzroVr48) by Andrewism

Andrew Sage talks about how technology alone will not save society, mindful application of technology can help though. He argues for a more tech critical world view and provides some questions and examples to help guide someone in being more tech critical. 

Would generative AI, crypto, or even smart phones as we have them have exist in their current state if we were more mindful of the application of technology through a humanist lense? Probably not. Technology should serve the purpose of facilitating healthy and happy lives in harmony with our environment, not whatever the [endless growth death cult](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/quitting-capitalism) thinks will sell more iPhones. 

As someone who loves tech and has a weakness for cool gadgets and what naught it hurts my soul that most of the tech we see these days is designed to be thrown away after a few years at best. A lot of tech is designed to distract us from real problems, take away our agency, and help facilitate the sell of more garbage tech that does the same. 

New companies are popping up all the time saying they will save us by reinventing the train, providing carbon capture, let us call a driver from anywhere, etc. They promise us these things, but are they necessary? Wouldn't it be better to invest that money in improving trains as they are a proven technology that doesn't get enough funding in many countries? What about instead of energy intensive carbon capture tech founded on dubious claims we focused on reducing the carbon emissions we produce and provide alternatives? Instead of exploiting people with Uber, Lift, or whatever flavor you like this week we could invest that money into better public transit and walkable neighborhoods? 

I'm not saying it is bad to explore and test out new things, but if we really thought about how to make people's lives better instead of how to make a quick profit (though that is [arguable](https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/8/24065999/uber-earnings-profitable-year-net-income)) we likely wouldn't have seen these technologies in their current form. 


### [FLATLANDER TECH](https://www.youtube.com/@FlatLanderTech/videos)

FLATLANDER TECH talks about videography and making stuff. I watched a few of his videos and there is good production value. When he talks about products he does it without making it sound like he is trying to sell them to you and just explains in an abstract way that the type of product is useful for x and that he uses y, but any will do. I have a weakness for watching people build stuff and he has been building things related to his videography, something I'm equally interested in.

I think it is a channel that will grow over time.

### [Morrowind Doesn't Have Any Rivers](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Li-Ph_gdqk8) by Any Austin

Any Austin talks about the "rivers" in the 2002 video game The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind. 

He argues that the rivers of Morrowind are sloughs, though he does dismantle the entire argument afterwards. It is a fun video and I recommend taking a look if you are interested in the rivers of one of the best video games ever made or hydrology of fantasy worlds it is worth a watch.

### [Commodore 64: Unboxing and Exploring the Incredible Musical Keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQk0YymAdys) by Veronica Explains

Are you a musician and use a Commodore 64 as your synthesizer? Have you had issues remembering what keys on the keyboard correspond to the notes on a musical keyboard? Veronica showcases a solution for you: The Incredible Musical Keyboard from Sight and Sound Music Software, Inc

Honestly keyboard overlays are a really cool thing from the past that we will likely never see again. It is awesome seeing people still enjoy old hardware, keep it out of landfills, and share their joy with others.

Also Veronica is part of a band that has an awesome [webpage](https://www.thestopbits.net) to checkout if you are interested.

### [Setting Up a Retro Rack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZxF_bJ6-qc) by clabretro

clabretro is setting up a server rack full of mid 90s and 00s networking gear. It is a cool idea and makes me wish I had room in my apartment to do something similar. 

### [The Bendix G15 Boots!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P48899B1WA) by Usagi Electric

Usagi Electric has been working on getting a [Bendix G-15](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bendix_G-15) working. He got it to boot. There is a lot of other things to do to get if fully working though. He made a [followup video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_jv15xgfEc) as well.

It is on loan from [The System Source Computer Museum](https://museum.syssrc.com)

### [11 things we WISH we knew when starting Plastic Recycling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DYP9wEnBew) by Brothers Make

Brothers Make talk about how they recycle plastic for projects. Plastic is a wonderful category of materials that sadly most of it ends up in landfills, even when you go out of your way to take it to a recycler. Brothers Make have developed somewhat safe and economical ways to recycle plastic at home/small workshops.

### [How Is This Website so Fast?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ln-8QM8KhQ) by Wes Bos

Wes Bos goes over some of the techniques used to make the [McMaster-Carr](https://www.mcmaster.com) website load extremely fast. It is something intreating to take a look at if you are interested in making complex websites load very fast. Something I might need to look further into.

### [My Kickstarter failed, so I open sourced it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jzG-BMannc) by StuckAtPrototype

StuckAtPrototype made a little remote controlled car that can get power-ups and interact with hazards in the form of different colored track underneath it.

This is a cool project and even cooler is that everything was released under the Apache 2.0 license. You can find the repo [here](https://github.com/StuckAtPrototype/Racer).

### [Fixing a Hand Plane With No Experience](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOpkCtVNIdI) by Evan Monsma

Evan Monsma goes over his experience fixing an old hand plane using the long lost art of experimentation.

Evan brings up the fact that in a world where all information is at our fingertips we often lose the drive to experiment and learn the why of things, instead focusing on the how. He also mentions how he feared the expense of maintaining a hand plane till he tried it.  

There is value in experimenting regardless of your craft, though that is probably an article for another day.

This video is part of his attempt to release a video per day in October between his two youtube channels and live streams. Also check out this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=obrbmPk42t8) where he repairs and builds a grip for an old camera.

His videos have a dreamy cozy feel that I would really like to emulate if I relaunch my youtube channel and start uploading again.

### [Personality Tests Are Dumb... And Dangerous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_AxwFOJRW8) by Wisecrack

Michael Burns from Wisecrack talks about how personality tests are both misguided pseudoscience and used to control workers.

Back when I worked for a large consulting firm they had us take a few personality tests so I know exactly how backwards corporate america is and how authoritarian the tests can be. The bigger danger I feel however is the idea that people don't change.

Stagnation is an evil thing and to some, personality tests are an excuse to stop changing and growing, even some of the personality tests suggest that personality cannot change. To deny a person their freedom to grow and change is a truly evil thing.

### [These Lawsuits Will Determine the Election (ft. Liz Dye)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dx_npZ9SHtk) by LegalEagle

Liz Dye from LegalEagle talks about how the US Republican party has been using frivolous lawsuits to interfere with the presidential election. I'm not a fan of being overly partisan, but this happened last election and will likely happen in the next one so I'd say it is a common pattern. Gerrymandering, making it hard to vote in person, and trying to throw out provisional and vote by mail ballots are all techniques that have been used by the RNC for a long time now so it should be no surprise that it is coming out in full force up to the election.

She also brings up the 2000 election where Al Gore lost due to election interference and bad ballot design in Florida. With the current US supreme court majority having a documented history of partisanship and corruption it is likely to be far worse this time around.

## More Next Month

I started this series with the goal of being a little more mindful about my consumption and to keep a somewhat consistent writing habit. It is amazing that I've kept this going so long. Here is to writing more in November.

If you notice anything interesting on the web please share it with me.

Thank you for reading.
