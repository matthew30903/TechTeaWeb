This is a post that has been in a draft state since the start of this year, but I kept scraping it. I just finished reading Starbreaker's post ["Personal Web, Personal Sovereignty"](https://starbreaker.org/blog/personal/personal-web-personal-sovereignty/index.html) and was thinking "I've had something similar sitting in my drafts folder for a long time". Also [32bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe) is having a ["what has creating a website done for you?" code jam](https://tilde.32bit.cafe/~hermit/community_jam_3/). Well here is my two cents about how owning a website is a step towards our own freedom.

A word of warning, I have a lot of half baked thoughts about this subject. I will try to make it coherent as I write, but this might not be my best work at the time of publishing.

## What is a Personal Website Anyway?

A personal website is a space you own on the internet. It is free from corporate overlords, financial influence, and social pressure. Many use it for their side projects, a blog, or a place to express themselves outside of societal pressure.

There is of course something very public about having a personal website. Broadcasting anything on the internet for all to see is far from personal, but it is probably the most human we can be on the internet outside of a chatroom with a few close friends.

I like to think of it as real estate. It isn't necessarily a home as it is public, but it is your space and everyone who visits is your guest. 

## Personal Websites as an Act of Rebellion

The mainstream internet slowly grew more corporate as the internet grew in popularity. A small bunch of hobbyist websites and a few early adopters bloomed into social media, advertising, and an increasingly centralized and financially incentivized space.

Nowadays there aren't many hobby forums, the non-tech blogs are dead and replaced with sponsor friendly content, and we own none of our content.

A personal website is the opposite of this. It is a space that doesn't need to make money (though it can), doesn't need sponsors or ads, and is not beholden to any rules other than that of the law.

People make amazing websites that look like they were [made in the 90s and are closed on mondays](https://melonking.net), [blogs from many people](https://peopleandblogs.com), [write whole novels in the open](https://starbreaker.org/fiction/index.html), and otherwise express themselves in ways that they can't in the real world or on social media.

None of these things are possible on the corporate web. Many more use their websites to post as what they feel is their true selves, you will see many trans, neurodivergent, and other people who are less respected than they should. None of them have to conform to the norms of society on their personal website. In this way they can take back their lives and find themselves, owning a website is a form of self-care for some. 

## A Website as a Part of the Self 

Social media is isolating, encourages conformity, and instigates fights. 

There is no nuance on social media, just the most extreme of an opinion. You can't have a detailed discussion about the impact of capitalism on society without being forced into either siding with big oil and tech or siding with the anarcho-communist that wants to behead Bezos. Don't get me wrong, one is probably far worse than the other and if you read any of my other articles you probably know what side I sit on, but there is so much more to the conversation here that will never be had. Why? 

Without nuance we fight, increase engagement for advertisers, and isolate ourselves into easy to parse bubbles. We become simple, easy to manipulate, and less likely to leave the group that we find ourselves in. The more extreme, the harder it is to have nuanced opinions and harder it is to find friends on the other side. This also makes it easier to advertise to because we are now part of a group, not an individual with nuanced opinions we are willing to share. 

On your own website you can just write your opinions as you wish, with as much detail as you wish, and with as much engagement as you wish. This means you can have nuanced discussions, think out your thoughts clearly before posting, and most importantly change your mind. You can form an identity entirely your own and share this identity with others. It is free of content moderation other than what you wish to share, free from advertisers and big tech trying to change your views to make it more convenient for them, and free from your physical limitations. 

Your website can be the most true public display of your identity when you are surrounded by those who despise you, lack encouragement from friends and family, or are in physical danger if you express yourself. It is a safe space to publicly express your identity.

## My Personal Website

Fortunately for me I've never had to deal with oppression for my identity.

When I first started my website back in highschool it was because I was told that everyone needs a website to help them get a job. I enjoyed throwing it together, but it never really went anywhere. I started blogging to help get tutorials out that could help some friends and maybe even make me some side income, but that also didn't go far as I was too inconsistent. 

Over time I realized my values (privacy, personal freedom, open source, etc.) and found that my website would probably be better spent talking about those things. Instead of making tutorials that focus on business use cases and trying to find problems others were having to solve I started to focus on sharing tools I love and teach others how to use them. 

I've never been one for social media, online forums, and socializing in general. I've always been a lurker, always reading and never posting. My website gave me a space to communicate my thoughts without social pressure.

My website became an extension of myself. It might only be my public mask, but it is still me and a me I only discovered by writing and scrapping many drafts and eventually publishing. I found my passion for technology, building human connections, and advocating for the things I believe.

## Make a Personal Website

I am a firm believer that having a website is one of the most useful things in breaking free from Big Tech, surveyance capitalism, and the boxes we are told to get into by society.

If you have the time try your hand at making a website. [The IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/), [32bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe), and [neocities](https://neocities.org) all provide resources and inspiration that can help you on your web journey.
