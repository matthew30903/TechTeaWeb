## Videogames

### Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty

I have still not completed Cyberpunk, but I recently completed its expansion, *Phantom Liberty*. It was an amazing experience.

Very basic overview for those of you who do not know: Cyberpunk 2077 is a FPS/RPG hybrid game created by CD Projekt Red based on the table top RPG Cyberpunk. You play as a terminally ill mercenary named V who is on a quest to save their life. On of the games claims to fame is the writing. Even the most minor side quest holds a lot of world building if you know where to look.

Now onto the expansion. Phantom Liberty is a generic spy thriller kind of story. None of the characters are particularly complex and the over all story is predictable, yet the execution is amazing. CD Projekt Red's writing team know how to make characters likeable and a story that should be fairly predictable interesting and engaging. As per their tradition, you often are given moral dilemmas and basic philosophical choices where either outcome is horrible. Cyberpunk is a game where you are always choosing between the lesser of two evils, where you are confronted with the fact that you can't always win, and sometimes you still can't give up even when you know it is hopeless.

On the other side of the spectrum, gameplay is fun as well. This is the only game where I can play a stealth blood mage (Netrunning) that uses throwing knifes while their mana (RAM) recharges. 

I guess my only real complaint about the expansion is it is short, one of my friends warned me so I can't complain too much. And when we say short, that is mostly in terms of the main story, it still adds a lot of other things to do in the game.

## Blogs

Blogs and personal websites are probably the best places to find insightful and interesting content nowadays. There are many other types of interesting website, but blogs are probably the most human. Here are some of the highlights of this month. Feel free to send me links to your blog or other ones you think are interesting.

### [100 things you can do on your personal website](https://jamesg.blog/2024/02/19/personal-website-ideas/) by James

James is full of positive energy and really knows how to inspire others. Here is a silly list of 84 things to do with your website along with a call to action to come up with more.

I'd really like to make some pages for books I've read and video games I've played one day. 

I think one suggestion not on the list is to add a /uses page like the one I have [here](https://techtea.io/uses/). List out the tools you use daily so others might be able to benefit from your experiences.

### [Being a webmaster is freaking cool](https://michal.sapka.me/blog/2024/webmaster/) by Michał Sapka

Michał Sapka stole my idea of writing why owning a website is fun and cool. Then again, I never published an article about it.

Michał writes a call to action for readers to get off social media and create something meaningful to themselves in the form of a website. He also admits it isn't for everyone, but it surely is better than being a slave to a faceless algorithm or contributing to a billionaire's ego. 

### [We ❤️ RSS](https://matthiasott.com/notes/we-love-rss) by Matthias Ott

Keeping with the theme of personal websites and owning our web we have Matthias Ott discussing RSS.

I've covered RSS [before](https://techtea.io/articles/2020/rss-our-information-diet/), but in short it lets you subscribe to websites to get updates. Many websites have feeds and have for a really long time, so there is a chance that your favorite site might have one.

Matthias discusses how we are having a resurgence in RSS's popularity. This is another hopeful sign we might one day take back the web from the more commercial focused entities. 

### [One way is always better than two](http://scripting.com/2024/02/11/153510.html) by Dave Winer 

Dave Winer is a very important person for the internet. He has contributed a lot, but one of the big things he did was advocate for syndication tech on the web (RSS).

In this post he talks about how RSS became the standard by compromising and collaborating with others.

Far too often we get competing standards, overly complex implementations, and forks of projects over minor disagreements. This makes it hard to accomplish anything, create anything of significance, or to collaborate with others.

He hit the nail on the head so I'm going to quote him verbatim:

>That doesn't just apply to you, it applies to all of us collectively. Every time you add something that already exists we're all going to pay for it.
>
>If you think that saying this makes me cantankerous -- well, I say okay -- but you're wrong because it's generous and brilliant to push back when people add complexity. Of course people don't like to hear they're doing something wrong, but when it comes to accumulating complexity debt unnecessarily, well imho you have to listen to that. Complexity is a force against interop.
>
>We should be looking for opportunities to work together to create something greater than anything any one of us can create.

I will disagree with him on one point, personally I do think sometimes reinventing the wheel can be a good thing. It helps us reexamine the problem we are trying to solve from another angle, understand the founding principles of what we are interacting with, and occasionally make something more beautiful that what came before.

Another word of caution, Dave Winer is very much politically active on his blog. He leans towards calling out media bias and flaws in our democracy, but has a clear left leaning biased. If you don't want to hear about what is going on politically don't look at his main feed till elections are over in the United States.

### [Publish Your Work](https://brainbaking.com/post/2024/01/publish-your-work/) by Wouter Groeneveld

Wouter Groeneveld talks about how we should put our stuff out there in the public. I will say it is always hard to write or make videos to share publicly, but he is right.

It is by creating and sharing those creations that we create a better world. I started this blog back in 2013 with the idea that one day I would share ideas and help others.

If you start sharing your work please send me an email, I'd love to see it.

### [In Loving Memory of Square Checkbox](https://tonsky.me/blog/checkbox/) by Niki

Niki runs a UI/UX blog. Just discovered it this month and will likely follow it for a while.

Here he discusses how many websites and even native UIs are starting to make checkboxes and radio buttons look the same.

Not only does this break with conventions that have existed since before computers had UIs, it harms accessibility and makes UIs harder to use.

Niki thinks that now that Apple is doing it (they have been doing it since the iPhone came out, but now it is on other Apple devices), the rest of the industry will follow.

To all the web designers out there: Creativity is cool and all, but think about accessibility and conventions. Some Conventions are in place for a reason so please stop styling text inputs, check boxes, and radio buttons to look like something they aren't. Make them look like your site, but make them distinct please.

### [Dan Hon’s resources for managing replies](https://rubenerd.com/dan-hons-resources-for-managing-replies/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade shares Dan Hon's fun [collection of images](https://www.flickr.com/photos/danhon/albums/72177720314761105/) with snarky replies to common comments people will often send others in the tech space. 

As Ruben comments, often unhelpful replies are not made with malicous intent, but due to a lack of empathy.

### [Empathy for those outside North America and Europe](https://rubenerd.com/empathy-for-those-outside-north-america-europe/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben points out the general ignorance and exceptionalism of the North American world view. Many on this side of the world often assume that if something is not american it is European style.

Also he makes a good point that pretty much anywhere has better public transit than most North American cities.

### [A DECADE OF WORKING REMOTELY](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/a-decade-of-working-remotely/) by Lynn

Lynn gives a fun list of musing she has had since working from home over the last 10 years. As someone who has been blessed with the ability to work from home for a while now I can agree with a lot of this.

One thing that stands out:

> Remote work requires trusting your team and that’s something you can choose to do at any time.

Whenever I see a company issuing statements about forcing people back to the office this is the thing I think about. These companies don't trust their employees, how can they expect their employees to care about the company?

There are a lot of other fun tidbits and it is a short read, take a look when you have time.

### [Where I’m at on the whole CSS-Tricks thing](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/02/28/where-im-at-on-the-whole-css-tricks-thing/) by Chris Coyier

For those who don't know, Chris Coyier was the creator of a fairly famous blog that covered front end development named CSS-Tricks. He sold it to Digital Ocean a while back.

The company eventually abandoned the website and burned a lot of good will they had with the community. Ultimately CSS-Tricks is still standing and that is, like Chris Coyier says, better than what most sites get.

In this post Chris Coyier gives his thoughts about the whole thing. A really good read honestly. 

Also [Manuel Moreale](https://manuelmoreale.com/chris-coyier-smells-like-donkeys) created a response to Chris's post.

## YouTube

YouTube is my default time waster and I've been trying to cut back on all that infotainment junk, but there are still a lot of good things on the platform.

### [Brick Layers: Could printing STRONG parts be so simple?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5hGm6cubFVs) by CNC Kitchen

Stefan from CNC Kitchen is back at it with a new way to improve the strength of 3D prints.

To do this he is adjusted the first layer heights in his slicer so every other perimeter is 50% taller than the one next to it. This means that the layers will have a stager between each perimeter, creating a interlocking pattern and thus in theory increasing layer adhesion. 

His initial test seems to have worked fairly well. We might start seeing this feature in more slicers as more research is done.

### [Los Angeles is a Parody of How You Move People in a City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9R7JV8gglgc) by Nimesh in Los Angeles

Nimesh talks about an issue that most of us living in a North American city know, cars kill people and the only way to fix that is provide alternative modes of transit.

He goes over the history of traffic deaths in the city of Los Angeles, the danger stroads and high speed vehicles pose to everyone, and some steps to stop it. 

While many other YouTube channels and writers have covered this topic I feel this video does a good job describing the problem to people who don't know about the issue or who have been fed pro-car propaganda.

LA might actually do something this time thanks to HLA, but one city doesn't fix the problem. We need to see a push across the country to improve public transit, widen sidewalks, narrow streets, and add bike lanes. Cars are expensive, dangerous, and usually unnecessary when viable alternatives are available. This is not a war against cars, it is a war against the unnecessary casualties of a society where everyone drives metal boxes at 50+ mph. You can still keep your car, even if you still drive you will see the benefits of this change as well because there will be less traffic.

### [Stow has forever changed the way I manage my dotfiles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y6XCebnB9gs) by Dreams of Autonomy

Dreams of Autonomy uses the Stow utility to manage their dotfiles using symbolic links. This prevents all that crazy stuff you have to do with git if you just turn your home directory or several dotfile directories into git repos.

I don't usually switch systems enough to warrant this, but it might be worth checking out in the future.

### [LA’s Forbidden Pedestrian Tunnels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pCOhIKto1VQ) by IT'S HISTORY

A new channel for me, but I've always been a fan of history and infrastructure.

This video covers the issues with car-centric infrastructure, the propaganda that auto manufacturers bombard people with, and the political corruption that lead to the car filled hellscape that is our North American cities.

Cars kill people and the manufactures successfully pushed the blame from themselves to drivers and eventually to pedestrians. The pedestrian tunnels that dot LA are one of the remnants of this propaganda that eventually made our streets unsafe and unwelcoming to walk.

### [Why Piracy Will Never Stop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWmufgTp6EQ&t=651s) by NationSquid

A random video I found. NationSquid covers the story of piracy and explains how corporations perpetuate piracy by constantly increasing prices and making paying hostile to customers.

I'd like to add that DRM, low quality products, and the overall push to a subscription market that makes piracy attractive to people who would otherwise pay a fair price for content.

### [Climate deniers don't deny climate change any more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3XSG2Dw2mL8) by Simon Clark

Simon Clark discusses how the climate change denial playbook has changed from outright denial to trying to prevent change by promoting apathy and a doom filled worldview.

Global warming is well documented as is the tactics that those who make money off the crisis have used to deceive the masses. In light of multiple years of record tempratures, abnormal storms, and loss of ecosystems, many have stopped denying the impact humans have had on the environment. Instead these people have switched to telling us we are doomed, denying the effectiveness of countermeasures, and otherwise generating apathy to prevent people from taking action.

To deny others hope is a truly evil thing to do, especially in exchange for profit. We owe it to one another to spread truth and hope when we know the truth, even when it costs us a little. 

I will try to cover more hopeful news as I write more about tech, current events, and the world in general. Not everything needs to be doom and gloom.
