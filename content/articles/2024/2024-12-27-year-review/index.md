description: A lot has happened here over the year. Lets take a look.
---

This year has been a crazy one. I've written more than 20 articles, created a new theme for the website, and started many small projects that will never see the light of day.

## Tech Stuff

I've done a lot with computers this year, so much that you might think I actually like the things. 

### Blog Optimization and New Theme

When I used WordPress I hardly tinkered with my website outside of some extensions and prebuilt themes. As a natural tinkerer I was unhappy, but also didn't want to spend the time to learn PHP.

After switching over to Hugo things were a lot easier. The documentation might not be amazing and you do have to jump through some hoops to get some things working, but most things can be done with basic HTML, CSS, and a little sprinkle of Hugo's templating language.

Thanks to that I was able to create my own [theme](https://techtea.io/notes/2024/07/new-theme/), [reduce the size of every page](https://techtea.io/articles/2024/march-website-update/) on my blog, and make the website more accessible overall. 

Obviously I'm not a great designer or programmer so there will always be something to improve and develop as I learn more next year.

### Switching to NixOS

I was using [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com) as my daily driver for a while, but it was growing slightly unstable due to my tinkering and wayland was not liking my Nvidia graphics card. [NixOS](https://nixos.org) looked to be a solution to a few of my problems. It is easy to roll back changes, it still has a fairly up-to-date package repo like Arch does, it uses a delative configuration file, and most importantly it had documented fixes for my Wayland/Nvidia issues when I started it up for the first time.

I've been using it for a while now and think I'm going to stick with it for a while longer. It has its quirks that make it a little difficult to use sometimes, but I've mostly worked around them. Overall it has been great and I'm able to tinker with a bit more assurance that nothing is permanently broken.

I have a laptop I use when I travel and still want a computer with me. While it doesn't get much use I'm thinking of switching it over to NixOS as well. It not being used as much means that every time I do use it an Arch update breaks something. I expect NixOS to be a little better.

### pfSense and TrueNAS

These two things have been game changers for my home networking setup.

I've been using TrueNAS on a home server I built several years ago, but the fear of losing that system and all the data it accumulated weighed on me. It would have been nice to get an off site backup, but I can't afford 40+ TB of cloud storage so I did the next best thing and ordered a [TrueNAS Mini R](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-mini/) from iX Systems. 

The TrueNAS Mini R is a rack mounted 12 bay NAS that has given me a lot to geek out about. I might go over it sometime soon. I'm still running TrueNAS Core, but I might migrate my old server over to TrueNAS Scale to see how it goes. Worst case scenario I now have a server to backup my other server.

I got a [Netgate 4200 BASE](https://shop.netgate.com/products/netgate-4200-base-pfsense-security-gateway) running pfSense this year and it was transformative. 

I was using a cheap consumer router with OpenWRT for a long time. It would overheat often, couldn't handle the traffic I was putting through it, and overall wasn't great. Now I have an open source router that I can use to simulate what I might need to do at my day job and that I can tinker with to my heart's content. It also boosted my download speeds by 300mbps so that is a plus.

### Being More Social

I'm not the most social person and don't usually go out of my way to talk to people. That said, I love people and love talking to them.

This year I exchanged emails with both [Wouter Groeneveld](https://brainbaking.com) and [Matthew Graybosch](https://starbreaker.org). Both wonderful and interesting people. 

I also made an account on 32-bit cafe's [forums](https://discourse.32bit.cafe) and have lurked there. 

## Life in General

I'm not the type to share too much personal information, but life has been rather good. 

My girlfriend and I have been trying to go on a date or at least reserve a day for us once per week. That has been great for our relationship and helped us explore the area we live. This is a habit that we are going to keep going into the next year. Might start posting about some of the places we visit if that interests anyone.

I've read more books this year than in prior years, mostly fiction. Between my e-reader, manga on my phone, and books on my shelves it has been about 2-4 books per month. I cheat a little by mixing in light reading between the heavy stuff, but still it is a lot of books.

Videogames were something I neglected, but I enjoyed Cyberpunk 2077, Atelier Sophie: The Alchemist of the Mysterious Book, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Factorio this year. I've only completed Xenoblade and the Phantom Liberty expansion for Cyberpunk out of all of them so far. I'll probably play Atelier Sophie to completion and might manage a playthrough of Factorio before I end up buying its expansion.

Got new glasses for the first time in years earlier this month. Turns out being able to see is a big deal.

Other than that my daily life is probably not going to make for great reading.

## Next Year's Plan

Next year is going to be a bit busy at work, but I have some plans for personal projects that will be fun.

I'm going to switch up my [monthly favorites](https://techtea.io/tags/monthly-favorites/) posts into a monthly review. Instead of long comments about other people's posts I'll share life/project updates and short summaries of the things I link to. The temptation to write a lot is strong though so we will see how that goes.

I'm planning to move my travel laptop over from running KDE to running a window manager and start using more terminal centric tools. It will be the first time I've done something like this, but the more I use computers the more I feel like modern tools are trying to take away my control over the system. I'm going to use the laptop to force myself to finally learn vim and all the tooling around it. Hopefully I will share my experiences here and it will be interesting to read.

There are a lot of small projects that I want to finish or start like the tea database/journal, my RPG Maker game, photography, a youtube channel, and more. Staying organized is going to be the thing that makes or breaks the these projects, but I'll try to post about them here for accountability.

There is a lot holding me back from being more social online, but I do plan to be a bit more aggressive and reach out to people via email. 

How has everyone else's year been?

Hope to see you all next year.
