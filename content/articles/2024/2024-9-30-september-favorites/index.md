## News

### [Sovereign Tech Fund to Invest €686,400 in FreeBSD Infrastructure Modernization](https://freebsdfoundation.org/blog/sovereign-tech-fund-to-invest-e686400-in-freebsd-infrastructure-modernization/)

FreeBSD got a grant to help them improve their infrastructure by Germany’s Sovereign Tech Fund. This is great because public money should go into public tech rather than go to proprietary licenses. FreeBSD is used all over the place, but gets less attention and thus less funding than projects like Linux. Open source as a whole has a funding problem and I think Germany is doing the right thing here in helping open projects improve and grow.

## Projects

### [Slowly booting full Linux on the intel 4004 for fun, art, and absolutely no profit](https://dmitry.gr/?r=05.Projects&proj=35.%20Linux4004) by Dmitry Grinberg

Dmitry Grinberg went through a bunch of hoops to run Linux on a 4-bit microprocessor, not just any one mind you, arguably the first commercially-produced microprocessor. It is an impressive achievement.

Fount this one via Ars Technica's [article](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/09/hacker-boots-linux-on-intels-first-ever-cpu/) covering it.

## Video Games

### Xenoblade Chronicles 2

I started playing this a year or so back, but got stuck on a boss fight and was too busy to grind levels so I left the game be. This month I decided I wanted to finish it so I booted it up, beat the boss, and finished the game. This game is good, in a self-aware campy kind of way. The combat is complex and needs some thought put into it, the story is cheesy in an overly anime kind of way, the English voice acting is mostly good (a rarely for JRPGs), and the characters are enjoyable. If I were to describe the game with one word it would be self-indulgent. It is clear that the developers were having fun with this one.

I can see why this is probably not many people's favorite game in the series. I've not played the others, but from what I hear this one is the most self-indulgent in the anime tropes and over the top clichés. That said, I can't help but love it. There is a level of self-awareness to the storytelling that makes everything click.

The game isn't hard when you know what you are doing, but I was brute forcing the combat system for my first half of the play through before it clicked, making the game needlessly harder than it should have been. I'm still not 100% sure I got it down, but after finishing the story I'll probably not touch it again, so I probably won't get any better at it.

Some criticism: Most of the side quests were fetch or kill quests without much framing around them so I didn't do as many as I wish I did, they become a slog to get through. The bigger gripe I have is that you will be doing a lot of walking and fighting. The world is on such a grand scale in an attempt to make the characters look small in the grand scheme of things and it works, but I've had to walk for minutes in some areas with either nothing to do but look at the landscape or fight enemies. Another issue that was sometimes annoying is that you will be in a level 30 zone in the game and randomly be attacked by a level 80 enemy you cannot survive. This doesn't always happen, but you can agro enemies fairly easily and you can't always outrun them.

I won't spoil the story as it is probably best experienced and if you want spoilers there are many online without me adding noise. The main conflict is between overwhelming self determination vs nihilism. The main antagonist behaves like an edgy teen who misread Nietzsche and decided to destroy everything because it is meaningless. The main character and friends struggle to find meaning for themselves in the face of no objective meaning. Fairly standard stuff, but still a more thoughtful exploration of philosophy than many games. I'm not giving it justice with my description. 

If you like JRPGs and can enjoy a little anime cringe you will probably like this one.

I've started on the 3rd entry and might go back to the 1st one sometime soon. I hear both have a more grounded tone than the 2nd one. 

## Articles

I changed the name of the section from blogs to articles because sometimes people post cool articles on magazines, editorial, and other kinds of websites that are not necessarily blogs.

### [How to Monetize a Blog](https://modem.io/blog/blog-monetization/) by Modem

This is an amazing post. I recommend you read it on desktop and once you are done use your browser's reader mode if you had trouble reading everything. 

### [The one feature I really wish Mastodon had](https://rscottjones.com/the-one-feature-i-really-wish-mastodon-had/) by Scott

Scott talks about his desire for a way to post locally only on federated Mastodon instances.

I'm sure I've shared this view in prior posts about the fediverse. There are many other fediverse servers and even forks of Mastodon that have this feature, but unfortunately vanilla Mastodon does not have it and is the default.

Kev also commented on this one in a post [here](https://kevquirk.com/blog/the-one-feature-i-really-wish-mastodon-had).

It is very unfortunate that Mastodon's developers do not want local timelines, but that is how most social media is designed. It is not a tool for fostering community, but a tool to get what you create to as many followers (consumers) as possible. I'm exaggerating of course, there are comments and things like that that help with the community thing a little.

People gather into communities when they are focused, small enough to know each other personally or by association to someone they do know personally, and somewhat private. The fediverse lets those small communities share their interests with a wider network of people, but without being able to post only to the people in their community they cannot create a strong identity or the ability to self moderate.

Till Mastodon adds a way to post only on the instance a user is on, the instances will have no choice but to either not federate or lose some of the special magic that makes small communities wonderful places to be. 

### [Wake up, it's a beautful day: the logistics of life](https://rubenerd.com/the-logistics-of-life/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade talks about the logistics and maintenance you need to perform as one gets older and life gets more complicated. 

### [Mental AI Fog and how to cure it](https://garrit.xyz/posts/2024-09-01-AI-fog?utm_source=rss) by Garrit

Garrit has been more reliant on LLMs than he would have hoped. He says this has harmed his own creative process.

I'm always going to be against generative AI. It is one thing to use a spell checker or AI to analyze what you wrote for clarity, but AI that suggests what to write is not helpful in the long-term for anyone's creativity. These kinds of tools take away our agency and our own ability to articulate to our selves.

### [Design ain’t a democracy](https://robinrendle.com/notes/design-aint-a-democracy/) by Robin

Robin's website is a beauty of design and here they argue that democracies are the worst way to build a product. They aren't wrong, look at the Wayland project every time GNOME disagrees with something. 

The reason things fail isn't because teams can't work, but rather most businesses and even open source projects are overly bureaucratic. When a project has a group of skilled people with a shared vision they will naturally work well together. 

I think the best approach is less democratic or dictatorial and more anarchist in nature. When a group has a clear vision of what they want, they don't need direct supervision because they are unified by a mutual goal. I don't think this comes naturally to everyone, but I've seen it in projects at work. 

When you have a clear vision and have a roadmap you can get a better product than something designed after years of bureaucratic bikeshedding, but that doesn't mean being closed off to discussion.

### [An advanced case of “In Their Defence”](https://rubenerd.com/an-advanced-case-of-in-their-defence/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben shared how he often will come to the defense of someone after they wronged him. I can relate to this, my girlfriend sometimes says I should express more anger. 

### [Gatekeeping in tech](https://michal.sapka.me/blog/2024/gatekeeping-in-tech/) by Michał Sapka

Michał Sapka makes the argument that advocating for hard to use tools is not gatekeeping, but abstracting away the complexity is.

I agree with him on this. Anyone who is arguing that advocating for vim, a window manager, etc. is gatekeeping is either not someone who is selling you something that abstracts it or is someone who doesn't want to spend the time to learn the tech they take for granted every day. That isn't to say everyone needs to use complex tools or that all abstraction is bad, but when tech workers don't know how the tech they use works they are losing significant power over that tech.

That is not to say we don't need accessible tools, we do. It is just that if we abstract everything we will be much less knowledgeable, less in control, and much poorer.

### [Holy Hell, The Social Web Did Not Begin In 2008](https://bix.blog/posts/holy-hell-the-social-web-did-not-begin-in-2008) by Bix Frankonis

Bix Frankonis shares some aggressive commentary on the hubris of some people forming an organization called the Social Web Foundation that advocates for ActivityPub. The thing he brings up is how this organization acts like social media is the start of the social web, ignoring everything else that has come before it. 

I do like the idea of protocols like ActivityPub, but it is not the first and arguably not the best way for people to communicate on the web. It has mostly been used to recreate the hellscapes of corporate social media, just with less money involved. Till Mastodon implements things like local timelines or platforms that do become more popular I'd argue that ActivityPub is not the social web, but a tool for broadcasting ideas as loud as possible. It can be social, but that is not the goal as is informed by its design. 

fLaMEd also wrote an [article](https://flamedfury.com/posts/a-social-web/) about this if you want more comments about this.

Also If you want to see how the web still connects and is social check out my recent article about [surfing the independent web](https://techtea.io/articles/2024/surfing-independent-web/). Don't forget that forums, emails, webrings, and blogs existed before 2008.

### [Heat Death of the Internet](https://www.takahe.org.nz/heat-death-of-the-internet/) by Gregory Bennett

This is a melodramatic view of where the internet is headed if it isn't there already. 

This is probably what the internet is like for a normal person who doesn't have computer literacy or the will to find alternatives to the tech that abuses them. Hopefully those who do know better will advocate for a better future and guide their friends who need help navigating an otherwise dystopian internet.

### [EmuDeck should not trickle down funds for emulators](https://redstrate.com/blog/2024/08/emudeck-should-not-trickle-down-funds-for-emulators/) by redstrate

I don't own a Steam Deck or any dedicated emulation device at the moment, but there are several major projects built around getting emulation working well on Valve's Steam Deck. One of those is EmuDeck.

redstrate talks about EmuDeck's donation page where they talk about donating some of their donations to the projects that they depend on to make their software. They doesn't agree with the way this is framed and would rather them be transparent about where the donation money is going.

I do think donating money to free software you use to make money is a good thing, I think donating to free software in general is a good thing. That said I agree with redstrate here that projects like RetroDeck do a bette job at being transparent about their donations and direct people to donate to the projects they are built on if that is where the value is for donors.

Trickle down donations really work when you have a foundation that takes care of many projects like KDE, GNOME, and the Linux Foundation. Not so much when one project is donating to other projects. 

While I have no stake in either of the two projects redstrate mentions I think it is a good thing to be mindful of what your donations go towards whenever you donate money.

### [Neurodivergence and accountability in free software](https://drewdevault.com/2024/09/25/2024-09-25-Neurodivergence-and-accountability-in-free-software.html) by Drew DeVault

This probably requires a warning as it does talk about the attempts by some to normalize sexual abuse in the free software community. I won't be offended if you skip ahead.

Drew DeVault is a major name in the FOSS software space and has opinions that sometimes get a lot of criticism. One was when he criticized Richard Stallman's statements about sex, particularly regarding minors. I won't go into detail here as Drew does.

Some defended Stallman saying being neurodivergent was a valid excuse for his behavior and words, DeVault disagrees.

I share Drew DeVault's post here because it is important. We cannot allow people to harm others or advocate for those who do run around with impunity in the FOSS community. If we do it will only invite harm to more people and prevent new people from joining this space. 

As for excusing Stallman's behavior with neurodivergence, it is insulting. By saying he can't help it people are taking away his agency and that of many others. Humans are able to learn, grow, and become better. Saying someone can't due to their ability is infantilizing, saying they can't do the right thing because of their ability is outright evil. Everyone makes mistakes, but doubling down on them after being corrected and using neurodivergence as an excuse is wrong. It is true that some people don't understand the norms related to sexual relations, but that doesn't give them the freedom to ignore them. They get corrected and then choose if they want to respect them or ignore them. You don't get to ignore the consequences for your actions or words just because you allegedly don't understand what you did wrong.

Moral relativism is a blight everywhere it rears its head, FOSS spaces are no different.

### [Experiencing Old Games In New Eras](https://brainbaking.com/post/2024/09/experiencing-old-games-in-new-eras/) by Wouter Groeneveld

Wouter Groeneveld talks about how he is trying to enjoy old games in modern times and the challenges with that.

Something I've been planning to do sometime is get my girlfriend and myself one of those cheap emulation handhelds, enable retro achievements, and play multiplayer with each other for games that support it. Community and avoiding guides that give all the answers it the key to enjoying any game, but it is hard when the game came out 40 years ago and has some obtuse mechanics. Discussing the games with friends and playing them together is half the fun, especially when something is a bit janky.

## Videos

### [3D printers are worse than I thought. Time to do something about it!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nofn_MHrxrs) by Thomas Sanladerer

Thomas Sanladerer reminds us that 3D printers do release a lot of harmful particles into the air. Many people who work with 3D printers forget the fact that they are melting harmful plastics and don't use proper protection.

Use a true HEPA filter and common sense when 3D printing. 

Thomas links to some of the research he has found and does his how tests to see what works and what doesn't. A good watch if you want more info. 

### [What Is React.js?](https://briefs.video/videos/what-is-react/) by Heydon Pickering

Heydon Pickering has a series of videos called Web Briefs where he goes over technologies on the web. In this one he goes after Facebook and their terrible practices while making fun of React.js.

The real moral of this video is don't use JavaScript to render your entire layout, especially when that JavaScript comes from Facebook.

### [Back When Rtfm Was Pleasant. (w/The Taylor and Amy Show)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4lUiUQOvRHQ) by Veronica Explains

Veronica, Taylor, and Amy discuss documentation and how a lot of modern documentation falls short and assumes a lot of prior knowledge of what your are reading, doesn't actually exist, or is horribly out of date. They show off some amazingly detailed, yet accessible manuals from retro computers.

Every time we make assumptions about a person's prior knowledge, lock support behind a discord server or other walled garden, or put someone down for not knowing the "basics" we lock people out of the amazing world of computers. Many people are growing up without any knowledge of how the systems we use every day work. The assumptions we make about their knowledge of computers can and will prevent all but the most determined from ever learning whatever system or tool we are documenting if we are not careful. 

### [DIY Laser Image Projector (100ft+ Range!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEPicBSYeNQ) by Ben Makes Everything

Ben explains how he built a color laser projector. The projected images give off a lovely 90s cyberpunk vibe for sure. 

### [How Amazon Killed Capitalism](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CNIsjGqMMWQ) by Clynt

Clynt talks about how Amazon not only creates its monopoly, but also how it propels us further into technofeudalism. 

### [The Nightmare of Disposable Technology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSJmwkWhvvs) by The Everyday Dad

The Everyday Dad talks about the need for right to repair, the horrible situation we are in thanks to the way the tech industry is, and what individuals can do about the issues that deposable tech pose to us.

What makes this interesting is that it seems The Everyday Dad is one of those tech shopping channels that are popular in YouTube tech spaces. These kinds of channels often showcase and "review" tech in exchange for sponsorship money. 

I'm glad that some of these channels are starting to see the awful world they are helping to create and are now using their platform to preach right to repair and sustainability.

### [How Do Linux YouTubers Create Videos?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9GllR4mEsg) by Reluctant Anarchist

Reluctant Anarchist had a few people from the Linux Youtube space share their setups for video production. It is completely possible to do video and other media production on Linux, but a lot of people don't know how. 

He had the following channels on:

[Brodie Robertson](https://www.youtube.com/@BrodieRobertson/videos)
[Michael Tunnell](https://www.youtube.com/@michael_tunnell/videos)
[No Boilerplate](https://www.youtube.com/@NoBoilerplate/videos)
[JustAGuy Linux](https://www.youtube.com/@JustAGuyLinux/videos)

[Linux Creative Project](https://www.youtube.com/@LinuxCreativeProject/videos)
[Nicco Loves Linux](https://www.youtube.com/@niccoloveslinux/videos)

### [The Insidious Myth of the "Skills Gap"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_Bb2EdX2_0) by How Money Works

How Money Works argues that the "skill gap" argument used to explain unemployment is a complete myth that is used by businesses to justify low pay, enslave migrants, and slow down public policy change.

### [Writing With No Words | Asemic Writing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1emgbzZSEY) by Idle Thoughts

Idle Thoughts talks about asemic writing. I've not always appreciated the art form and to this day I'm still not big on a lot of the more abstract examples, but I appreciate the concept and absurdity of it. And Idle Thoughts brings up the idea that asemic writing could be seen more often nowadays in defiance of AI and the power over language that big tech has over all of us.

I think it is worth considering. How we are increasingly restricted on what we can write due to AI co-writers, spell and grammar check, word limits, and SEO. Our relationship with language is important, be it written, spoken, felt, seen, or otherwise projected in a way we have yet to discover. I don't think we should be restricted by what a machine or corporate nutcase thinks we should be able to write.

In any case, take a look at the video. It is rather interesting.

### [DIY Creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Opkmr7kAAk) by No Boilerplate

No Boilerplate talks about how they grew into a creative. He advocates for being a generalist and building a large variety of experiences and skills.

He practiced many skills, talked publicly because it was something he saw as a weakness, and how he started his youtube channel and podcasts. 

The idea of specializing and only knowing one thing deeply is profoundly terrifying to me. In schools and all over the internet we are told to specialize if we want to go far in life, but I've yet to see the practicality of that advice. Maybe I'm wrong and would be making what would be considered a living wage if I specialized, but I'm also sure I would be miserable and have way less time for my hobbies (like this blog).

## That's All for this Month

I've been busy with work and life outside, but I do want to start highlighting new websites and creators in October.

Please let me know if you find anything interesting on the internet, have a comment, or want to discuss something with my email linked below.
