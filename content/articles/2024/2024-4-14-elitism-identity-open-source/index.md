description: There is an elitism problem in any community and the Linux and FOSS world is no exception. We need to change that.
---

As with any community there are a few people in the Linux and FOSS world have their fair share of elitists. These people firmly believe they are morally and often intellectually superior to those who use proprietary software. 

These people are impossible to reason with and poison people's opinion of Linux and the software we use. Unfortunately they are the loudest bunch.

Ruben Schade recently posted on the Fediverse about how Windows users have the right to complain about the enshitification of the Windows operating system. He was calling for empathy for the people who have no choice but to run Windows. The responses were so awful he had to make a [post on his blog](https://rubenerd.com/people-who-need-to-run-windows/) addressing them. Kev Quirk also posted about the immaturity of these folks on his [blog](https://kevquirk.com/linux-elitism-again). Even one of the admins, [@pamela](https://bsd.network/@pamela/), had to publicly announce that they had to block and ban people from the instance because of bad behavior relating to Ruben's post.

How can one expect someone to join a community that actively mocks and ridicules them?

I'm a firm believer that Linux and BSD are superior to Windows as operating systems, but that doesn't make the users of Windows any less than a Linux user. If anything they deserve some respect for dealing with an OS that fights them every day.

It might be hard for one of the kids who used Linux for 20 years to realize, but Linux is not easy. It has its flaws. Not everyone has a choice and must use Windows: their hardware might not support it, they might need Windows for work like I do, they might not have the time to learn something new, or maybe they expect their computer to work like an appliance and not a tinkerer's playground.

Instead of belittling these people we should show solidarity against large corporations like Microsoft. No one should have to pay to have their data stollen, unethical AI shoved down their throats, and ads placed in their OS. If you really are so much smarter than the Windows user please teach them what you know (as in make a video or blog post, don't be like Windows and shove your ideology down their throats) instead of acting like a fool. 

The FOSS community must show empathy and want to help these people move to better platforms like Linux. Telling them that they deserve to suffer for using Windows is not helping anyone. Teach people how to use Linux, advocate for governments and public education to use free and open source software, and help develop tools to onboard new users. Do that and people will use Linux and FOSS, they will have more freedom, and the tools you use will also be better for it.

Finally, don't bully the elitists too much. They have a fragile identity based solely on the software they use, show empathy. 

If you feel like you have gotten stuck in a trap where one thing has become your identity try out some new hobbies, go outside, and try reading a book. You are more than just the software you run, the job you do, your sexual identity, the religion you partake in, or the diet you keep, you are a human capable of being many things and don't need to cling to any one identity. If you want to share one of those interests to others don't bad mouth or look down on those who don't do things your way, keep an open mind and you might just learn something yourself.
