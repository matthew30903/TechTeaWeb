description: This post is part of the IndieWeb Carnival July 2024. I've found many tools that are joyful to use, here are some of them.
---

[James](https://jamesg.blog/) is hosting a great prompt for this month's [IndieWeb Carnival](https://jamesg.blog/2024/07/01/indieweb-carnival-tools/) and the topic is something I've been meaning to write about for a while now, Tools.

I use many tools in my day to day life and many of them are mundane or even hinder my workflows, but over time I've found many tools that truly spark delight and curiosity in me. Before I list some of them I want to quickly go over what I think makes a tool joyful to me.

## What Makes a Tool that Sparks Joy?

Here are my completely biased criteria for tools that bring me joy.

- It must be useful, obviously. There are lots of tools that I'm tempted to get just for the sake of having them. Owning more without reason is opposed to joy.
- It needs to give me control. If it thinks it is smarter than me then it is out.
- It should feel nice to use. A tool that does the job, but doesn't feel great is a tool that will rarely be used.
- It must enable me to tinker. If I can set my own rules for its use, customize it, or use it in the process of tinkering with other things then it is much more joyful.
- It needs to be user serviceable. A tool that cannot be repaired is a liability and wasteful.

There are numerous other things that make something joyful or make it dreadful to use, but these are the major things that come to mind. Without further delay, here are the tools that are a joy to use.

## A Good Electric Kettle

While I mostly talk about tech here I have documented my love for tea. Long ago I used to just boil water on a stove top in a sauce pan and let it cool to what I though was the right temperature. It was cumbersome, didn't produce great tasting tea, and generally discouraged me from making tea often. At some point I saw the [Stagg EKG Electric Kettle](https://fellowproducts.com/products/stagg-ekg-electric-pour-over-kettle) and ordered it after saving for a few months. 

This kettle is still not the perfect for the job, it is slow to pour, but it is much better than what I was using previously. Now I can brew teas at the exact right temperature, heat water to boiling in just a few minutes, and enjoy a great looking kettle. It is admittedly overpriced compared to the cheaper options you can find at Walmart and Target, but they just didn't inspire me like this one did and this is one luxury product I feel it was worth splurging on as I use it multiple times each day.

If I were to get a new kettle or could redo my choice of kettle I'd go for their Corvo model as it would be far better for pouring large amounts of water.

Another reason for buying from Fellow is that they sell some replacement parts. All companies should sell replacement parts.

If you make tea or just need to boil water often get a good electric kettle, even us Americans with our lower power grid can benefit from one. 

## Prusa i3 MK3S+ 3D Printer

I strongly believe that 3D printers are one of the most amazing tools to come to the consumer market in the last decade. They give normal people the ability to prototype ideas, fix things they own, and even produce products without having years of engineering experience and manufacturing contracts. 

My first 3D printer was fiddly and always had something go wrong when I actually needed it for a serious task. After saving for way longer than I wanted to, I got the [Prusa i3 MK3S+](https://www.prusa3d.com/product/original-prusa-i3-mk3s-3d-printer-3/) as a kit and spent a few weeks whenever I had free time putting it together. I got the Prusa because it is open source, the company has a good reputation, and their printers are known for being reliable. There were cheaper printers at the time that offered more fancy features, but none were as proven Prusa. 

This machine has been sitting on or near my workbench since December of 2022 and has served me well. I've fixed my broken glasses, made my phone case, fixed things around my apartment, and produced small gifts for my girlfriend with it. It has been abused with little care and still runs like a champ.

I don't use my printer every day and even go months without using it sometimes, but I know that the printer will be there when I need it. I put it together so the [Ikea effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IKEA_effect) is in full power and I know how to fix things when they break. Also it is the only tool I've ever owned that came with a bag of gummy bears, if that doesn't spark joy in you I don't think anything will.

## A Computer Running KDE Plasma

Back into the realm of computers, I love Linux and the [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/) desktop environment. It is powerful, customizable, and still easy to use. KDE is probably why I still love computers today. 

Before I used Linux I was a Windows user. I used Windows 95 for a time and it was fun, I had to use floppy disks to transfer files from my dad's internet connected Windows XP computer to it and there was something intentional about that. Unfortunately I was too young and lacked knowledge of computers at the time so I didn't get too into it. 

Then I got a Windows XP computer from a yard sell. It was a Dell Optiplex like you would see at schools and businesses. I abused that computer so much on a software level. I replaced the boot screen, the shell, themed it, etc. It never looked like Windows again after I got my hands on it. I also started getting into Open Source, video games, and anime thanks to it being internet connected. My dad had a fancy new Windows 7 computer, but I learned that XP was where it was at for my interests. That was probably the most joy I had in computers till I switched to Linux full time on my personal devices.

I shared a Windows 8.1 laptop with my sisters for a while and that was very depressing. Eventually Windows crashed and we needed to fix it quickly so I threw OpenSUSE on it and it was a little fun, but it wasn't my computer to do whatever I wanted to with so I was limited. I actually wrote my [first blog post](https://techtea.io/articles/2013/just-started-this-blog-and-instaled-cairo-dock/) from that computer.

I was eventually able to build a custom computer, I installed Windows 8.1 on it and upgraded to 10 as soon as I could, got it all up and running with games and software for fun, and didn't take nearly as much joy in it. The computer felt like a tool for running the things I could take joy in rather than something that could bring me joy in itself. I didn't tinker other than to disable all the ads and tracking, I would still have fun modding games, but it wasn't the same. Windows is boring and buggy. I lost a lot of interest in my computer and tech itself just using it.

I eventually dual booted OpenSUSE with KDE on the thing and it made life a lot better. I could tinker, change anything, break things and fix them where Windows would just break and need a reinstall, and the best part was that I could do all of this without the trappings of proprietary software. There was no spying, no ads, no "You can't do that because I know better than you", no real limitations. I couldn't play all my games anymore, but to be honest tinkering was more fun anyway and with a bit of tinkering with WINE I could get some of my favorite games working. Eventually I forgot my Windows partition all together and went full time on using Linux.

KDE Plasma is a tool that lets me use my computer my way and brought the love for tech back into my life. I would likely never have started this blog if it wasn't for it and their open source community.

## Hugo

I've talked before about how much joy using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) for this blog has brought me so I will not restate it here. It lets me use any text editor I want to generate my website incredibly fast. I can tinker and rapidly prototype ideas even with my limited knowledge of web development and standards. Hugo is a tool that made managing this blog joyful again after using WordPress for years.

## My eReader

I am the type of person who loves reading. I have shelves worth of books sitting in storage, many books on my shelf in my apartment, visual novels make up a sizeable chunk of my Switch collection, etc. It should be no surprise that a eReader would be on my list.

I was always reluctant to get one at first because I love physical books, but at one point I started reading far more than I used to and the number of books I needed to keep up with grew out of control. This is extra true for manga and short serialized books. My phone and computer are not ideal for reading for long periods of time so eventually I gave in and got a Kobo Aura One and loved it. I still read a lot of physical books and love getting them as gifts, but the Kobo has a place in my reading life.

It has 32 GB of storage, is easy to load books onto with [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com), supports a lot of e-book formats, doesn't need internet to work, has a large screen without being too bulky, and isn't tied to my most hated e-commerce giant. I mostly use it for reading manga, but when I can't get a physical copy of a novel I will often get a epub and load it up on the device. [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org) is an amazing resource for getting a hold of classics by the way.

A few things that would make it better: faster response times, being open source, and having easy tools to highlight/annotate books and export them to markdown. Sadly the device is no longer being made/supported and I'm not about to get a new one till I either lose this one or it breaks beyond replicability so I'm not likely to get anything better for a long time.

## Other tools that spark joy

Most of the stuff on my [Uses](https://techtea.io/uses/)/[App Defaults](https://techtea.io/articles/2023/app-defaults/) pages.

A good fountain pen. It makes writing feel much more intentional and really does spark joy.

My split keyboard on my Uses page is probably the standout from that page. It fixed a lot pain and gives me a way to tinker with my keyboard in a way I was never able to do before.

I think the key takeaway is that tools that enable me to tinker or are themselves something to tinker with bring me joy.

What are tools that bring you joy to use? Send me an email and let me know.
