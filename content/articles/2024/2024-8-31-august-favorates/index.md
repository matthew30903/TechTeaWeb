description: I've read and watched a lot of stuff this month. Here are the highlights. I hope you find something you didn't know about before.
---

I've not been doing much on my computer this month and will have a lot of articles and videos to catch up on next month, but there was still a lot of great stuff this month.

## Life Stuff

I did a lot of life admin things this month as well as had a lot of activities going on outside of work and digital spaces to keep me busy. 

A few friends and I myself have birthdays in August so we hung out for the first time in a long while. 

I went to the California Science Center, Griffith Observatory, Los Angeles Natural History Museum, and the La Brea Tar Pits Museum with my girlfriend during this and late last month. Very busy, but it is always a lot of fun going to these kinds of places. Highly recommend visiting if you are curious about the amazing world we live in and are in the Los Angeles area.

A Nvidia driver update broke the GUI on my computer so I was a week without my computer till today. I switched from EndeavorOS (Arch, but a little easier) to NixOS. The transition is a little slow, but I have a functioning system up and running way quicker than I thought. I'll probably live in NixOS for the time being assuming I get all my tools working. The whole concept of Nix is interesting to say the least and it will probably be a little better for someone who is always tinkering than Arch was due to its rollback feature. 

Also I got a TrueNAS Mini R to backup my janky home server/NAS. It is very quiet, uses less power than my home made server, and gives me access to support when it breaks. The only thing I can say against it is it is big and expensive. If you want a NAS running open source software, want to support the development of said software, and want something closer to what a small business would have you should take a look at iXsystems' Mini line of NAS boxes. You can of course just load up TrueNAS on most hardware and have a server running without giving up as much cash.

## Video Games

I'm still playing the games from last month, but I've added one new one to the currently playing list.

### Animal Crossing New Horizons (Switch)

I've never played an Animal Crossing game before, but my girlfriend had a copy that she hasn't really touched and I saw it had limited multiplayer so I got a copy and started playing with her. It is a fun game for what basically amounts to a busy work and capitalism simulator. The characters are charming, the gameplay is simple enough to get the hang of quickly without being so simple that it is just mindless. At the end of the day it is a cute collectathon type of game. My girlfriend is absolutely obsessed so this is another game that is going to be played for a long while.

## Blogs

### [Fifty shades of people and their blogs](https://manuelmoreale.com/fifty-shades-of-people-and-their-blogs) by Manuel Moreale

Manuel runs an amazing project called [People and Blogs](https://peopleandblogs.com) where he interviews people who run blogs and personal websites.

He recently interviewed his 50th person. It is an amazing project and the people are all amazing as well. Discovery is not as easy without search engines endorsing personal websites so projects like these help a lot.

There is also a lot of inspiration to be had if you want to run your own website. 

### [On hobbies, side projects, and money](https://manuelmoreale.com/on-hobbies-side-projects-and-money) by Manuel Moreale

Manuel also gives his insights on hobbies, projects, and the costs associated with keeping them going. I generally agree with him on his points and will probably write my own article on the subject sometime.

### [Our first home server, and rekindling that joy](https://rubenerd.com/our-first-home-server-and-rekindling-that-joy/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben shares the story of his first home server and the joy it brought. It is a wonderful little post and makes me want to tinker more with my home server again.

### [Sites over platforms over sites](https://rubenerd.com/platforms-over-sites/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben talks about the future of the web and how platforms are not the answer, but maybe can sort of be one day. Federated platforms are similar to RSS, the solve a lot of the problems with the natural monopolies of platforms, are a little easier to get into than running your own website, and are resistant to enshitification.

This is another subject I'll probably have to write my own article on sometime soon.

### [You can contribute to KDE with non-C++ code](https://rabbitictranslator.com/contribute-to-kde-without-cpp/) by Thiago Sueto(Herzenschein)

Not sure what name to use as his website doesn't list it, but on KDE's gitlab it is Thiago Sueto and other sites it is Herzenschein.

Thiago Sueto talks about places where KDE can use some contributions that don't require C++ to work on. KDE is one of my favorite open source projects, but many people are scared away from contributing because the project uses a lot of C++.

Fortunately there are places where you can contribute using other coding languages. There is also documentation needed, translations, and likely a lot of other things the project could use that aren't listed here.

### [Has the IndieWeb Become Irrelevant?](https://starbreaker.org/blog/tech/has-indieweb-become-irrelevant/index.html) by Matthew Graybosch

Matthew Graybosch talks about how the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org) is irrelevant to many and overly complicated by its attempts to integrate with the corporate internet. 

Personally I live the idea of having a central hub on the internet that then sends out the information I want to other places, but in practice all the IndieWeb stuff is redundant when you have RSS and JSON Feeds, Meta tags in your header, and an email address. As Matthew states:

> The onus of integration and interoperability properly belongs on the shoulders of platforms. If they seriously cared about syndication from websites and blogs, they would do a far better job of supporting RSS and Atom feeds.

If platforms really wanted to integrate with our sites they would let us using existing tech. I love the idea of [EchoFeed](https://echofeed.app) and [WebMentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/), but they shouldn't be necessary. 

All that said, I do think the IndieWeb is cool from a tech standpoint. While I don't want to integrate into larger platforms I love the idea of being able to share stuff from my website and notify other websites or build decentralized platforms for sharing interests. I don't think the tech is necessary for most people and the fact that some people think it is necessary speaks of the problems with the corporate web. 

The IndieWeb has been great though from a community and discovery standpoint, without it I'd not have discoverd other blogs, converted my own website over from wordpress to Hugo, or discovered other parts of the independent web. [32-Bit Cafe](https://32bit.cafe) is probably doing a better job at getting non-techie people into the independent web space, but the IndieWeb is helping a lot as well.

To me the tech aspect of the IndieWeb is a fun toy to thinker with (I've tried doing a little of it on this website), but I also don't use social media so it is unlikely that I'm the target for a lot of it.

## YouTube

### [Project 2025: A Hellish Legal Vision For America ft. Liz Dye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bQcL0t73O5Y) by LegalEagle

Liz Dye from LegalEagle goes over some of the things from the Project 2024 policy paper proposed by the Heritage Foundation.

This one is very much political. I tend to shy away from non-tech politics, but this effects everyone.

Basically if a Republican gets elected to the presidency in the United States the Executive branch of the Federal Government will fall entirely under Republican control.

They will censor books, schools, and even the national weather service. They want to privatize transit. Ban reproductive health in general. They don't even want kids to be in schools, rather they would have them work in dangerous facilities. They want to control every aspect of our lives.

Republicans have always been the party of big business, but now they are doubling down on the big government part. Even worse, they want to export their authoritarian agenda to other countries using the U.S.'s overwhelming international power. If there was ever a time to fight for freedom in the U.S. now is a good time.

No one at the Heritage Foundation stopped to think about the consequences of these policies. It lacks a fundamental understanding of human nature, democracy, and anything it is trying to control. Also remember, this is the parts they thought would be okay to release to the public. Imagine the other insane things they wrote and then decided to scrap because it would cause more outrage than this already is. 


### [I Made a tiny Miniature PC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-pACEENHBw) by Salim Benbouziyane

This is a cute one. Salim Benbouziyane made a working prop retro computer using a raspberry pi. 

Projects like this bring the fun back into the overly corporate computing world. I really need to work on my 3D modeling/CAD skills so I can make projects like this.

### [The Daoist Scriptures Are Huge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mWt4mLSOB-0) by ReligionForBreakfast

Dr. Andrew M. Henry goes over the history of Daoist canonical text and how they are different from how many western religious groups understand canonical scripture.

It is very interesting and worth a watch.

### [Guide: Open source free CNC CAM - Kiri:Moto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nQUvXOjDib4) by Teaching Tech

Michael from Teaching Tech provided a basic guide for using Kiri:Moto to work with CNC machines. It is an amazing open source tool. If you work with CNC machines you might find it useful.

### [The Hidden Side Effects of No Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGIcjbOyNyU) by Tariq10x

Tariq10x argues that No Code frameworks are not great for software engineers and likely not great for anyone.

The idea of No Code is that software can abstract a lot of the complexity of programming languages into an easy UI for people who don't know how to code, basically this is an advanced WYSIWYG. This can make coding easier for non-programmers and eliminates the need for more complex understanding of computers and the systems being interacted with. This might sound like a good thing to some, but it can lead to some problems.

Tarig10x argues that this shifts money away from engineers and to these no code platforms, limits creativity as these platforms couldn't ever provide the same flexibility as a programming language, create vendor lock-in, and ultimately harm the overall understanding people have of the technology they use (colleges and schools will want).

In general I agree with his statements here.

### [How Capitalism Becomes Feudalism (Severance and Technofeudalism)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6pq6DjpRbGo) by Literate Machine

Literate Machine talks about how we over time the disparity between techno-capitalists and workers has grown to the point where we are entering a feudalistic society. Instead of kings we server our corporate masters.

He is not wrong. Union busting, paying employees in gift cards in the style of coal mine company stores, expecting employees to provide their own equipment, etc. All of this is leading to a world where our employers and a few tech companies control most aspects of our lives. 

I do think we are seeing a strong push back against this future, but Literate Machine questions if it will be enough. I do hope so, but for change to happen people do need to stand together and right now many are divided.

He also uses the show Severance (2022) as the setup for his premise. I need to see that someday.

### [Vimjoyer's Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@vimjoyer/videos)

I just got into NixOS today, but this channel on youtube has been very helpful on getting my head around some of the things where Nix's own documentation is lacking.

If you are interested in Nix or NixOS take a look. There are other channels out there two, but Vimjoyer is still very small and has good production value from the few videos I've seen so he deserves some attention.

## See you in September

That is it for this month. I know I've not written as much this month, but life happens. This monthly favorites project is really helping me keep up with my writing a little more than I otherwise would have been though so that is a big plus. One of my coworkers who reads some of my blog posts even commented that they noticed I've been writing a lot more this year than in past years. That is a huge motivator.

Next month I want to review some more teas I've been drinking as well as get the prototype tea database up and running. If you have a suggestion for what data I should include in the tea info or how it should be layed out let me know.

I also will likely write a little about Nix and NixOS as I tinker with it and break things as well as how I got everything somewhat up and running in a day. 

The monthly favorites will likely be longer as well seeing as I'm behind on all the RSS feeds published by fantastic people on their websites.
