*This is not a technical article or even my normal "share stuff from across the internet" kind of thing. Sorry if I get something wrong, feel free to correct me. There are people who are far more knowledgeable about this than me. Nevertheless we all need to say something.*

It takes a lot of courage to stand against those whom you know to be evil. Matthew Graybosch wrote a [post](https://starbreaker.org/blog/personal/wearing-bigotry-on-ones-sleeve/index.html) on his own website regarding an experience he had recently with some sad and angry person who aired his hate in public. To an outsider who never experienced anything like this before they might think spouting a snarky remark and walking away like Matthew did is nothing, but the reality of it is confrontation is terrifying and even more so when the one you are standing against has motive and likely the power to do harm to you.

I've had friends in the past who have been attacked for the way they present themselves, for the way they were born, and for the way they simply exist. They don't feel protected by their families or their government. They are mocked and provoked in public. One was spit on just casually walking down the street, the one who spit was armed so they just walked away without any further confrontation. It takes these people courage to just go to work each day. Most don't have it in them to stand against their oppressors after being worn away like this.

We may very well be entering into an era where the U.S. government is hostile to its own people and those who would take advantage of that have already started to do so. Who are people supposed to turn to when mobs of people who think they should exist are marching down the streets? Who should someone turn to when the very government that their parents voted for proposes to erase protections for people who do not fit into a specific classification of people?

All that is to say, tolerate no evil because no one deserves to go through all this.

That is where each and every one of us comes in. You don't need to be brave enough to punch a bigot in the face (I don't think that is productive anyway) or blow up an oil refinery that is polluting the water in a rural town, but there are things you can do. 

- It all starts on a local level. Support your friends. Make them feel welcome, valid in their concerns, and safe. 
- Create resources for people to use. This could be providing books that are being contested, support groups, articles on tools that can improve ones safety, etc. 
- Write to your local government about ensuring basic human rights and if you have time join town/district/city meetings (a luxury most of us cannot afford by design). 
- Donate to charities that support the marginalized and oppressed if you can afford it. 
- Educate people. Most people aren't evil because they are inherently that way. They choose to be because they are afraid and have been bombarded with propaganda all the time. That is unless they are rich, they are profiting off all this and need to be dealt with another way.
- And if you are feeling brave like Matthew Graybosch was, tell the one doing evil that you will not tolerate it.

As a whole we need to stand against anyone who would do harm to another human being, but that is not easy. None of us really know what to do now that it has gotten this bad, but something needs to change. 

I'll be writing more articles in the future with this in mind, technology that empowers people to speak and be themselves without compromising their safety and privacy. 

If anyone has any resources to share or experiences they have had let me know and I will link them to this article.
