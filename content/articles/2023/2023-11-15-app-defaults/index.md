A lot of blogs I follow seem to be posting their default applications they use and I figure I should share mine too.

I mostly use open source software and services. I self-host Nextcloud and that has taken the roll of syncing all my data between my desktop and phone as well as removing dependance on 3rd party cloud providers.

I'm a fan of keeping things you want to remember in a physical medium so I try to write my notes in a notebook before transferring long term notes to pages in Logseq. 

I'm not a fan of office applications like word processors and spreadsheets so I rarely use them. Plain text is usually the better format. I used to Use LibreOffice more when I was in school and before I learned about Markdown.

If anyone has some suggestions for future good open source applications please let me know.
