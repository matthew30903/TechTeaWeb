description: I've read and watched a lot of stuff this month. Here are the highlights. I hope you find something you didn't know about before.
---

2024 was a crazy year. This is going to be the last post in this format because I want to try something a little different in 2025. I'll still be sharing links to cool stuff, but I want to add more notes about the places I've been and personal experiences. Maybe a monthly review. 

## Personal highlights

I visited both my direct and my partner's family for christmas calibrations throughout the christmas week. It is a blessing that public transit in southern california is good enough to make that possible. Had some great company and food.

My girlfriend and I went on a couple of dates this month and the one that stood out was the [Balloon Museum](https://balloonmuseum.world). It is an interactive museum full of interesting things related to balloons of all shapes and sizes. There is a giant ball pit there, you are not too old to enjoy a ball pit.

Also got rather sick for a couple weeks during the month, but I'm mostly better now.

## Projects

### [wttr.in](https://github.com/chubin/wttr.in)

This amazing tool lets you check the weather using `curl`. Why would you want to do that? There are many impractical reasons like checking the weather from the server you are currently SSHed into, building your own GUI around it, or adding a status line to another terminal based tool.

There are so many cool things this one can do. Check it out if you didn't already know about it.

### [Using a DIY tool to add custom QMK features to your Oryx layout](https://blog.zsa.io/oryx-custom-qmk-features/) by Pierre Poulain

Pierre Poulain created a cool tool that lets you combine custom QMK code with ZSA's own Oryx keyboard configuration tool.

I use a ZSA Moonlander keyboard and love it. Their Oryx tool makes configuration much easier than writing QMK configurations manually, but has limitations in what it lets you do with the keyboard.

Pierre's tool lets you send your layout from Oryx to a github repo, combine it with QMK code you wrote in another branch, and then it compiles the firmware for you so you can flash the new configuration to the keyboard. 

I'm not the biggest keyboard power user, but I already have some ideas for what I can do to help improve my work. It is a really cool concept all together. Really can't wait to play around with it.

### [Self-Hosting Isn't a Solution; It's A Patch](https://matduggan.com/self-hosting-isnt-a-solution-its-a-patch/) by Mathew Duggan

Mathew Duggan argues that we need more regulations regarding privacy and data portability across the tech world. 

Many technical minded folks see self-hosting as a solution to the privacy nightmare that big tech has wrought on the internet, but it isn't possible for most people to host their own services because it is either too expensive, requires skills they have no desire or recourses to develop, or don't have the time to devote to maintaining their own systems.

The solution is not to wait till federated and self-hosted tech all of a sudden becomes popular, but instead to make it a legal requirement that companies respect privacy and basic human dignity. 

I generally agree with this idea, the EU's GDPR and California's CCPA are steps in the right direction, but we need more and we need it universally.

That said we do need self-hosted solutions as viable alternatives to commercial services (having laws for data portability would help here). We need resources to help people who want to develop the skills needed to develop and run self-hosted software. This could also turn into a rant about the education system and helping people learn how to learn so I will stop here.

Found this one via Terence Eden's [post](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2024/11/self-hosting-is-an-unhelpful-term/) commenting on Mathew's.

### [I think the donation notification works](https://pointieststick.com/2024/12/02/i-think-the-donation-notification-works/) by Nate

Earlier this year KDE implemented a small notification that asks for donation starting December 1st. This is a good thing as more people will donate if you ask them to than will if you don't.

Nate shares that donations up significantly and the community has responded positively. 

It just makes me happy seeing a project I use all the time develop a decent strategy to gain donations. Hopefully they can replicate Thunderbird's success.

### [Substack vs. Indie](https://blog.ayjay.org/substack-vs-indie/) by Alan Jacobs

Alan Jacobs talks about how Substack is still just another social media platform and writers on the platform are not independent. To be independent on the web you need to have a website or place you actually own. Found via Manu's post: [On blogging, substacking (?), and owning digital real estate](https://manuelmoreale.com/on-blogging-substacking-and-owning-digital-real-estate).

Generally I agree and there are a lot of other reasons to not like Substack other than it's inevitable enshittification.

### [ChatGPT is a tool, not my mentor](https://kangminsuk.com/blog/chatgpt/) by Minsuk Kang

Minsuk Kang talks about how AI language models are tools, not mentors or learning aids.

I feel like this goes for all technology, I don't think tech should be a substitute for your own ability to think about, experience, and otherwise discover new things.

### [I should write a blog post](https://axiixc.com/blog/2024-11-22-i-should-write-a-blog-post/) by James Savage

James Savage talks about not feeling like doing anything. There is no problem with not doing anything sometimes, but that doesn't mean you feel that there is no problem with it. His feelings are all to relatable.

### [modernity is stupid: a rant not about politics](https://phirephoenix.com/blog/2024-11-05/modernity) by Jenny

Jenny rants about how crazy the world is and what finally broke the camel's back was when Omnivore was sold to an AI company. 

The idea that people need to keep up with work, who funds the tools and products they use, politics, their health, etc. just to function in modern life is overwhelming. 

### [Kindness in a transactional world](https://manuelmoreale.com/kindness-in-a-transactional-world) by Manuel Moreale

Manuel Moreale talks about how transactional everything feels nowadays, but also how kindness leads him to do things without hope for reward as well.

A world built around the accumulation of wealth and personal gain has no room for this kindness, but that is all the more reason to be kind and value people and things for their own sake rather than what you get out of it. It might not change the world, but it might change someone else's world.

### [Overengineering a Way to Cheat at an Exam](https://www.akpain.net/blog/the-pi-hotline/) by Abigail Pain

Abigail talks about how she created a phone number that recites the first 100 digits of pi for an exam she had.

It is a fun concept and fortunately the number still worked when I first read this article. 

### [Unpopular Mozilla Hot Takes](https://trafotin.com/blog/2024-12-21/) by Trafoltin

Trafoltin talks about how Mozilla should pay their executives less, invest in products people actually use (Firefox, MDM, etc.), and stop relying on money from Google to stay afloat. If they can't do that they should die so others can take their place.

It is with a heavy heart that I agree. Mozilla has mismanaged their products and their reputation. The only reason I wish they can stay around is that it is necessary to have some kind of competition against chrome and its spawn. Maybe [Ladybird](https://ladybird.org) will be useable in a few years. 

Firefox is still a good browser for most people and it is more private than chrome. The problem is that chrome based browsers like Brave and Vivaldi exist (even if they have their problems) and people are more likely to use them than Firefox if they are going after something more than the default.

### [Is stuff online worth saving?](https://rubenerd.com/is-it-worth-saving/) by Ruben Schade

Ruben Schade is a data hoarder like myself and was thinking about the value of saving stuff online. 

Like him I agree that it is important to save digital things, even if they hold little meaning to others. I don't think everything is necessarily worth saving, but if you enjoyed it, shared it with others, or otherwise got value out of it maybe you should consider how to archive that thing for the future.

### [The Cost of Self-Hosting](https://kevquirk.com/blog/the-cost-of-self-hosting) by Kev Quirk

Kev talks about the different types of self-hosting, their cost to him, and the different things he hosts and where he hosts them. 

### [Your AI help bot is a phone tree](https://coryd.dev/posts/2024/your-ai-help-bot-is-a-phone-tree) by Cory Dransfeldt

Cory Dransfeldt talks about how AI help buttons on websites are basically phone trees where you play a choose your own adventure with the company's knowledge base/docs.

The only person who thinks these things are useful are the people who have never used them before. They waste everyone's time and make it hard to want to do business with the one who added the thing to their website.

On a related note. At work we recently had a client that switched from a traditional phone tree to an AI chat bot you talk to for navigation, it never works. I hated them before they became AI, hate them more now. It just means that employees from that client have to leave their cell number instead of their main line if they want a call back. It makes our team look bad, delays patient care (we are in medical), and in general makes it painful to do business with them. AI of this type is a fun toy at best and should never have made its way into the medical industry.

### [LLMs are everything that it wrong in the world of computing](https://crys.site/blog/2024/llms-scare-me/) by Michał Sapka

Michał Sapka is not a fan of abstraction for its own sake nor is he a fan of overly complex software. LLMs and Generative AI represent basically everything he is against in modern computing. He also fears that in the future most things will be abstracted to AI to the point where most people will see the inefficient and non-deterministic software as the default rather than as bad software. 

### [How Google is killing independent sites like ours](https://housefresh.com/david-vs-digital-goliaths/) by Gisele Navarro and Danny Ashton from HouseFresh

HouseFresh is a air purifier review website that claims to perform in-depth and real reviews of products. In this article they talk about how google is promoting garbage over independent websites in the review space and makes these kinds of in-depth reviews unsustainable.

They did a few followup articles as well where they talk about how they got essentially [de-listed from google](https://housefresh.com/how-google-decimated-housefresh/) 

And another article where they talk about [sorting through slop on search results](https://housefresh.com/finding-helpful-content-in-an-enshittified-google/)

> "If we don’t stand up for our right to a free and open web, we’ll be stuck with platforms that only let us reach other people when we pay for it."

I found this from Chris Coyier's post [Watching Google Search in 2025](https://chriscoyier.net/2024/12/30/watching-google-search-in-2025/).

In an ideal world good businesses wouldn't be at the mercy of big tech platforms and publishers wouldn't be owned by private equity and venture capital, but here we are.

If you care about the open internet use [alternative search engines](https://techtea.io/articles/2024/surfing-independent-web/) and do research on who owns what you are reading.

## Videos

### [The Pursuit of Knowledge Saved My Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U7Q_euysSUM) by Nerdy Rambling

Nerdy Rambling discusses how reading and the pursuit of knowledge changed him. Reading and journaling made him a better thinker. Even though he isn't a natural reader the desire to learn has helped him create the discipline to continue reading. This in turn helped him get over the idea that he wasn't smart.

It is an interesting watch.

The pursuit of knowledge is one of the few things that kept me out of depression when I was younger so this one really got to me.

### [The Real Reason Why Lumber Quality Today Is so Terrible - And What You Can Do About It](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=efs5-FCVWvg) by DIY with Dave

Dave talks about why lumber quality in the US has gone down significantly over the years. He also reminds people that they don't always need the best quality lumber before going into how to gauge the quality of lumber you see in stores.

I do appreciate that he mentions that not all tasks need high quality materials. Many people get caught up in the idea of only using the best for everything.

### [Try these filament combinations for Multi-Material and Supports](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VV2fbJ0apg) by Made with Layers (Thomas Sanladerer)

Thomas Sanladerer goes over the way multiple 3d print materials interface with one another. It is a great overview if you have a multi-material printer and want to use support materials or know what sticks to each other for some kind of practical part.

### [How I Transformed my Office into a Fantasy Medieval Study](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dcYdwgCz3js) by Living Anachronism

Kramer from Living Anachronism talks about how he built a medieval set for his office. His passion for what he has created really shines through.

I've been wanting to create a set for my office space sometime in the future too, his video is pushing me more into turning the idea into a reality. 

### [Redesigning my Computer Workstation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-g2L55ZIlY) by Evan Monsma

Evan rebuilt his workstation area. I love seeing people's work spaces and watching workspace/desk tour videos  is a bit of a guilty pleasure of mine. A major problem is a lot of videos on YouTube are made for YouTube sponsors and don't represent a space that people really work in. Evan built his out of scrap wood on a budget of $0 so it is a great change of pace.

Feel free to send me photos of your workspaces if you are willing to share.

### [Math in the Homelab - A World Record?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isayM2lnRdA) by Jeff's CTO Laboratory

Jeff Sponaugle has an overkill homelab and one of the things he has been doing with it is computational math. In this video he explains the need for lots of RAM and storage as well as his methodology for finding the next two longest known sequence of numbers that repeat in Pi.

It is an interesting video worth a watch. He also has a [blog post](https://sponaugle.com/wp/math_pi_repeat/) about it as well.

### [Gong Fu Tea|chA - Episode 32 - Tea Vessels: What Kinds and What Are They For?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cBdqarM18SY) by Tea House Ghost茶館鬼

So-Han from the West China Tea House talks about the history and purpose of various tea vessels. 

So-Han always shares great information about Chinese tea culture. If you are planning to get into tea I would highly recommend checking out the channel.

### [This Stupid Thing Might Actually Work - DIYson Lamp Build Log #12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY1SuTu32fk) by Steven Bennett

Steven Bennett has been building his own open source lamp inspired by the Dyson Solar Cycle lamp. I've shared the project before, but he just released an update video.

### [How I built a Mechanical Calculator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0pJST5mL3A) by What Will Makes

William Gerhardinger makes a digital mechanical calculator. An awesome project for sure. It also looks like he has a [blog](https://whatwillmakes.com).

### [How (And Why) The New York Times Lies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mhYS59egWQc) by Second Thought

Second Thought talks about how the New York Times promotes american funded dictators and anti-socialist propaganda.

The U.S. has a strong history of funding dictators, overthrowing democratic elections, and otherwise trying to secure financial interest in other countries so none of this is news, but Second Thought goes into how the NYT spins it.

Second Thought is a socialist propaganda channel so normally I'd say take what he says with a grain of salt. This is a well documented issue though. The companies that own the U.S. are not fans of socialism or anything that prevents them from exploiting people away from public concern. They have and will continue to rig elections in other countries, instill dictators, and exploit people for all they are worth with the backing of the U.S. government.

### [A Workbench Can Be as Simple as This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHdX4xWH9YY) by Studio No Ha

Studio No Ha operates out of a very small space and thus needs a small and modular workbench. He talks about the intimacy he has with the material as he works with hand tools, the power of keeping things simple, and working with the material instead of forcing it to do as he pleases.

### [I Streamed To A Game Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPI6gURLLUs) by ChromaLock

Last month I shared a video by ChromaLock regarding adding internet capabilities to a TI-84. This month he created a way to stream video from his computer to a GameBoy Color and naturally played [Bad Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8wtjzO3A9a4) on it.

If it has the capabilities of simulating or playing video people will play Bad Apple on it, a meme that I hope continues far into the future.

### [How to Make 3D Printed Segment Displays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2BOyJqzJVC0) by Ben Makes Everything

Ben makes a segmented display with a custom font that can display any number or letter commonly used in English. While the T and I are a little off it is very impressive creating something like this and making it 3D printable. 

### [A Brief look at Text Rendering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qcMuyHzhvpI) by VoxelRifts

VoxelRifts talks about the many ways text is rendered to the screen and how Unicode renders different characters based on the script and language being used.

If you are curious about the subject it is worth a watch.

### [The Skill Issue, or: How I Learned I Could Learn, and So Can You! (also capitalism is a disease)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PSmgNgsW3io) by Sane Retry

Sane Retry talks about how he learned to learn and why it is valuable as well as how poverty and videogames shaped his world view.

This is his first video essay so it is a little all over the place, but I feel that it kinda fits his whole theme about learning. 

He encourages everyone to learn new skills, spend life creating stuff that is meaningful, and how learning and creation is a rebellion against a system that exists solely to exploit people for money.

He put it well:

> "In a world that wants you to spend your minutes making the rich people richer, spending your minutes on yourself is an act of rebellion."
