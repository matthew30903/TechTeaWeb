description: A lot has happened this month. Lets go over what has been going on in my world and share some fun links. 
---

The views expressed here are purely my own and do not reflect that of my employer or anyone I'm affiliated with (should be obvious, but I'm in the country where you can be fired without notice).

Ukraine did not start the war, Canada is a sovereign nation, NATO has been critical pact that protects the United States just as much as it does Europe, vaccines save people's lives, and Denmark doesn't owe the United States Greenland.

With all that is going on in the world today I fear this post is going to be more politically charged. When you see your country being turned into a playground for oligarchs it becomes something you feel compelled to talk about. You can skip this one if you don't want to hear about all of that.

## A Busy Month

This was a crazy month. 

The first was my partner and I's anniversary. We went to the Little Tokyo neighborhood of Los Angeles. This has always been our go to spot for dates. We tried out a new to us ramen place, spent way too much on books from the book store over there, and generally enjoyed ourselves. 

Then we had to visit a friend all the way in Fresno, CA later in the month. The bus and train ride were less than fun, but we made it. Fresno is a walkability nightmare and way colder than LA around this time, but it was a fun experience overall. My partner and I visited the Fresno Chaffee Zoo while we were out there. I always love zoos and it is a decent way to support conservation while enjoying time with friends. Unfortunately the Forestiere Underground Gardens were closed, but if we ever go up there again we will try to check them out. 

Not all has been going well, however. The U.S. government is being dismantled by egomaniacs and oligarchs. They president and his cronies is threatening our allies, draining our water reserves, trying to gut every government program that helps the environment and the common person, and doing anything they can to make themselves richer while making those less fortunate than them suffer. If they were just trying to make a quick buck it would be one thing, but they are actively going out of their way to make others suffer. 

## Fear for the Future (US Politics)

My thoughts are a bit of a mess on this, but I feel like I have something to say.

I fear for the future right now. The country I live in has allowed corruption of the highest degree to take power. The ones in power love it, the ones not in power are divided by dehumanizing propaganda, the Democrats are toothless against the Republican Party's indifference to Trump's shameless disregard for the law, etc. Bigots have been emboldened to come out of hiding and our rights are being eroded. Our collective history is being erased across government websites and the majority Republican opinion is that they need to censor our independent media as well. 

In 6 months I might not even be able to send a letter to someone (post office has been a favorite target of Republicans) or even use the internet freely.

Things need to change for the better and fast. 

Regardless of party affiliation please reach out to your state representatives and tell them to grow a backbone. No president should be above the law. If you were a MAGA republican and still are after all that has happened then you need to do some deep self-refection. Any person that denies life and freedom, preaches intolerance and hate, and spreads dangerous lies for political gain is evil.  

On the bright side the U.S. has seen massive protests and a few state reps have started discovering the backbone they sold to ExxonMobil. Let's protect what we have and start taking back what we can. Civil disobedience, spreading truth, and fighting wherever and whenever we can is our duty.

If they want to be kings we will treat them like the French treated Louis XVI. 

## Things I Learned

So I often see people mention Linux/Unix tools on their blogs like this `ls(1)` instead of just `ls`. I had no idea what the number in the parenthesis was. Turns out it is the section of the manual where the item can be found. When using the `man` command to read the documentation for something you can specify the section of the manual you want to look for. `ls` is a general command, section 1. If there is an `ls` in section 6 (games) you could specify if you want the general command or the game by typing `man <SECTION> ls`. Don't know how useful this is to know, but I didn't know it and now I do. Thank you, [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man_page#Manual_sections).

## Games

Still playing through Star Ocean, but have hardly touched it this month.

I also started playing X4: Foundations. So far it has been addicting, though I'm still in the early game.

### Articles

Ars Technica shared a story about the [California Condor's reintroduction to the wild](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/02/return-of-the-california-condor/). Something a bit happy in our world. It is very fitting that I found this article on my RSS feed after getting home from my trip to Fresno and the zoo out there.

On a related and less happy note, the Trump administration tried to [get rid of an important report on the state of nature](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/02/after-trump-killed-a-report-on-nature-researchers-push-ahead-with-release/) and its impact on the United States. It looks like the research and report will still get out there, but without the government helping out with the project it won't be the same.

Matthew Graybosch gives a call to action to Americans to [stand up against the current regime in the United States](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/these-men-no-mere-cowards/index.html). I don't like being overly political, but this isn't about politics at this point. The oligarchs have control over the U.S. and want to see it burn for profit. The president has threatened our allies, created a new tax on the poor via unfair tariffs, harmed those who came to the country looking for better lives, [drained the water](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/31/us/trump-water-california-central-valley.html) used for our crops, and so many more evil things. All of this to make a quick buck and look good to people who wear evil on their sleeves. It has only been a month and the damage is already great. I hope I'm completely wrong about Trump and his ilk, but if things continue as they are we are in for a rough 4 years. 

Flamed Fury talks about [Blogging for the Hell of It](https://flamedfury.com/posts/blogging-for-the-hell-of-it/). Creation is one of the most important things humans can do, even more so when we live in exciting (hard) times. Then again, the more people who create stuff the more likely I'm going to end up reading articles than actually posting my own. 

Flamed also referenced Folkmoss's own blog post about [writing and active rest as a form of recovery](https://folkmoss.bearblog.dev/blogging-just-because/). 

Ruben talks about how [Sometimes nerds just have to explain something](https://rubenerd.com/sometimes-nerds-just-have-to-explain-something/). This is something I'm all to familiar with and I'm getting better at too. I'm not trying to be annoying or patronizing, but it is easy to want to help people by going into way too much detail about something they already know or don't really care about. It is also how I think through problems. My girlfriend and several of my friends are probably tired of hearing me yammer on.

Ruben also mentions that [Boring tech is mature, not old](https://rubenerd.com/boring-tech-is-mature-not-old/). This is something I 100% agree with. Boring is good when it comes to tools and computer tech is a tool. I say that even as someone who loves tech and loves getting shiny new things to play with. I don't want userspace to break or a feature I rely on become deprecated, if an update breaks it then it is not useful. 

Manu talks about [Identity](https://manuelmoreale.com/identity) and how reductive labels are. Each and every one of us is a complex being. A few words couldn't possibly be descriptive enough to capture who we are. Unfortunately modern identity has little room for nuance. We are not defined by our looks, what we do to survive, or a single misguided belief. We are defined by the complex combination of all those things and more. Labels can be useful, they can help find community and common ground, but they are also destructive when they are all you see.

Dave Rupert shared his thoughts on Government Efficiency on his [RSS feed](https://daverupert.com/atom.xml). As it is part of the [RSS Club](https://daverupert.com/rss-club/) I will link to his feed rather than the article itself. Does sharing a link to it break the rules? He talks about originally believing in the promises of capitalism, but coming to realize the places that the government absolutely should step in. The government should absorb the inefficient things, take on the things that don't make money, and correct the exploitative nature of the capitalist system. Generally I agree with him. 

James talks about tools for the [future of the web](https://jamesg.blog/2025/01/16/next-decade-of-the-web-tools). I agree with him that tools should empower us to make things on our own terms. The future of the web can be bright, we just need to find a way to let people know that there is an alternative to all the big tech/endless growth death cult stuff that is mainstream nowadays.

Jatan Mehta talks about how he removed a lot of the [digital distractions and nastiness](https://journal.jatan.space/digital-detox/) out of his life. I found that almost anyone who talks about a digital detox or finding joy in tech uses an RSS feed to manage their digital consumption. More people need to learn about web feeds, it truly makes life better for everyone (except advertisers, but they shouldn't have it easy).

Den Delimarsky talks about the [importance of owning your own property on the internet](https://den.dev/blog/be-a-property-owner-not-a-renter-on-the-internet/). I've already spoken about it to death, but it always feels good to get more confirmation bias from another perspective.

Miriam talks about how [AI and tech in general is political, is being cooped by oligarchs, and how depressed it makes her](https://www.miriamsuzanne.com/2025/02/12/tech-ai-wtf/). I like to argue for tech optimism, but we are indeed in dark times. We need to work together to turn that around. Generative AI is a technology that is fundamentally designed to remove the human element from all things. Other recent advancements in (popular consumer facing) tech have often been built to get around government regulation, take agency away from individuals, and generally make life worse for everyone. There is a log of good things out there, but as long as billionaires and their ilk are in power we are going to have issues.

Wouter talks about the [toxic work mentality coming from big tech and startup culture](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/02/no-rules-are-implicit-rules/). These companies love to give employees "freedom" knowing full well that social pressure will keep them in check. I've seen this kind of thing first hand and hate it, the fact that books like the one mentioned in Wouter's post are popular is very sad. Hustle culture is a cancer on society that needs to be removed.

Michał Sapka talks about the [joys of writing with a nice fountain pen now that he is writing differently](https://crys.site/blog/2025/pen/). I really need to learn cursive, my writing looks terrible. Using a fountain pen really does help improve the legibility and fun when writing.

Wouter wrote about his own [stationery drawers](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/02/my-stationary-drawers/) after I posted my [article about the subject](https://techtea.io/articles/2025/stationery/). His collection of stationery is certainly more impressive than mine, as to be expected from someone who writes as much as he does. I look forward to having a notebook shelf filled with notebooks like he has in the years to come.

### Videos

DRTV from the Danish public broadcast service took some [comedic shots at Trump's warmongering over Greenland](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wDskHrvLYk). I'm glad that they are taking it in good humor, but it is sad that the president of the U.S. is threatening our allies. Anyone who thinks that Trump is on the side of the American people need to really think deeply about it. This guy is bad news. There is also the [Denmarkification website](https://denmarkification.com), a joke petition for Denmark to buy California from the U.S.

Tale Foundry talks about the [romanticization of victimhood](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gB6qKzCVIeU), the stories that play into it, and the stories that subvert it. It is a complex and interesting subject for sure. He also mentions *Perfect Blue*, one of my favorite movies.

TechDweeb goes over the joy he gets from [playing old console games on his computer with a keyboard](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOhl0PsEF-M) and how he set it all up. TechDweeb has built up a whole character around his channel steeped in nostalgia for old video games. If you are interested in old games and how to get the most out of them you should check out his [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@TechDweeb/videos).

I'm not the biggest music person out there (I mainly only listen to music when it is already there like in games or movies), but I found out about Björk's [Bachelorette music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUxdcwao0bE) and it is great. 

There is a genera of hustle bro YouTube videos centered around making money on YouTube. They tell you how to monetize your content, how to game the algorithm, that you should always outsource your editing, etc. It is very depressing and soulless content made to sell courses and help other people pump out the same depressing and soulless content. The Zatzman talks about the [YouTube tutorial hell and how it is at odds with creativity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3g0j2p_OYt4). He is a filmmaker, but most of the people peddling these "How to YouTube" tutorials are business people. There is a lot to unpack here, but it is a fun watch. 

Not Just Bikes talks about [Dutch streets and the klinkers (bricks) used to make many of them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cq1kV6V_jvI). I live in Los Angeles, CA, a place known for its car dependence and terrible street design, so Dutch urban design always fascinates me. Imagine if the U.S. took even half of what the Dutch do instead of trying to undermine public transit. Streets would be safer and people would be much happier. There is a decent urbanist movement out here and things are getting better, but the city is still cut by freeways and stroads everywhere.

This one is as funny as it is sad. Patrick Boyle goes over some of the [worst megaprojects being developed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-65bHmC9HY4). This one is not a must-watch, but the dry humor is great, and sometimes it is nice to have some terrible mega structure to hate on.

Addie from EposVox talks about the importance of [archiving the web and how to do it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGuXTFyxLe0). I'm sure I've shared something similar before, but it is more important than ever with a bunch of U.S. government websites being nuked, research and education institutions being attacked, and even news outlets being threatened. We need to make sure that information stays free (as in freedom and as in beer) and accessible to as many people as possible.

Bryce Bostwick shows us how he reverse engineered part of Google Maps to create a browser plugin that [restores the label for the Gulf of Mexico](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F5m2JxplnXk) to the correct name. It is interesting to see.

Abe shows his [Raspberry Pi Pico powered cyberdeck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnwPmoWMGqk). A fun and interesting project. It has its own application launcher and can load apps from expansion cards he built. 

Technology Connections covers the [issue with algorithms curating our consumption, encouraging hot takes, and even doing our thinking for us](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEJpZjg8GuA). Being fed opinions from a computer is likely a key player in the current state of the United States, and I'm positive it isn't limited to just here. 

## Lets Hope for a Good Rest of the Year

I pray that things change for the better in the United States. I feel for all who are suffering due Trump's illegal executive orders and at the hands of emboldened bigots. 

I tried real hard to avoid the news this month, but when evil shouts "I'm going to pull medical research funding during the worst avian flu season" you are going to hear about it. This is the least of the things that have happened this month.

Over the next month I'm going to focus more on video games, local activism, reading, and generally recovering from the rough month. 

Please tell me if you like this format or if I should do something different for the links section. I was doing heading before, now it is just separated paragraphs. I could do bullet points. Not sure what would make things more digestible and readable.
