description: I finally created a photo gallery.

I finally created a [photo gallery for the website](/photography/)!

Several months ago I got a Sony A6700 camera and have been taking photos constantly. I've been meaning to get a gallery setup, but life and procrastination happen. One of my friends started her own website on neocities and that inspired me to work on the gallery. This has been a long time coming and is still a work in progress, but it should be perfectly useable. 

The Hugo template is fairly simple once I figured out how to do it. You can see it on [the theme's repo](https://github.com/matthew30903/techtea-theme/blob/master/layouts/photography/single.html).

It gets a list of all webp images in the img directory and displays each photo inside a picture element. The picture will show webp if the browser supports it and jpeg if it doesn't. Clicking on the photo opens the jpeg currently as I think that is what most people would want, but I can change that in the future if people want to more easily download the webp images.

The gallery could look a lot nicer, but it will do for the time being.

I only have my first few photos uploaded currently, but I will process the rest of them in the near future. Once I'm caught up on photos I want to upload more regularly.

I am going to be backdating the gallery pages to closer match with the month I took the photos, but all pages are new.

I'll do a photography workflow post in the near future, but right now it mostly consists of me downloading the photos to my computer, sorting them into the correct dated folder, tagging and cleaning up the photo library in Digikam/Darktable, and using ImageMagick to format them for the website. It is very much a work in progress.

If anyone has suggestions to improve my templates, photography, or processing workflow please let me know.

Feel free to take a look at the new [Photography](/photography/) section on the sidebar.
