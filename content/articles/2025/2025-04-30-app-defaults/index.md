description: Here are my default apps for 2025.
---

My last app default post was back in 2023, some things have changed since then.

📨 Mail Client: [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net)  
📮 Mail Server: DreamHost - it is included for free with my hosting.  
📝 Notes: [Leuchtturm1917 A5 Hardcover Dotgrid Notebook](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/notebook-medium-a5-hardcover-251-numbered-pages-oceandotted.html) - I completely removed Logseq from my personal note taking and switched to bullet journalling.  
✅ To-Do: Bullet Journal using same notebook as above.  
📷 Camera App: [Open Camera](https://www.opencamera.org.uk) - A Sony a6700 digital camera is slowly replacing my phone camera.  
🟦 Photo Management: [digiKam](https://www.digikam.org/)  
📆 Calendar: [Nextcloud Calendar](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/calendar) for Server / [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) and [KOrganizer](https://apps.kde.org/korganizer/) on Desktop / Simple Calendar on Android.  
📁 Cloud File Storage: [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com) / Network Shares running on TrueNAS Scale.  
📖 RSS: [Newsboat](https://newsboat.org) - Moved away from NextCloud News as it was getting buggy and I don't check RSS on my phone anymore.  
🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts: [Nextcloud Contacts](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/contacts) for Server / [KAddressBook](https://apps.kde.org/kaddressbook/) and [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) on Desktop / Simple Contacts on Android.  
🌐 Browser: [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) / [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com) - Note that Vivaldi is not entirely open source, the UI is completely proprietary.  
💬 Chat: [Signal](https://www.signal.org) / Discord Website (I'm not installing their spyware).  
🔖 Bookmarks: Notebook / My [Monthly Favorites/Review](https://techtea.io/tags/monthly-favorites/) posts. Omnivore sold out to an AI slop company.   
📑 Read It Later: Same as above. Don't use a read-it-later service anymore.
📜 Word Processing: I do everything in Markdown now so whatever text editor is available.  
📈 Spreadsheets: [LibreOffice Calc](https://www.libreoffice.org) / Almost never use.  
🔐 Password Management: [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com)  
🧮 Text Editor: [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com) / [Kate](https://apps.kde.org/kate/)  
🖥️ Desktop Environment: [KDE Plasma](https://kde.org/plasma-desktop/)  
🔎 Search: [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) though I do play around with [indie search engines](https://techtea.io/articles/2024/surfing-independent-web/).

Over the last couple of years I've been moving away from using my phone for things outside of communication. As such I've been able to lower my dependence on Nextcloud a lot. At some point I found myself writing things down in notebooks more than I was using Logseq, so I dropped it for anything outside of work. I'm slowly moving towards a decentralized and more minimal tech setup. I'm finding more that I can do with the terminal on Linux, more ways to organize my thoughts with paper, and more ways to distance myself from phone dependence.

If anyone has some suggestions for future good open source applications please let me know. I'm especially interested in terminal utilities and things I can automate.
