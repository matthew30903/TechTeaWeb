As much as I'd like to avoid any more politics, the United States currently has a president that thinks he is above the law. Tomorrow he is planning a military parade for his and the U.S. military's birthday. Not only is this a waste of taxpayer resources that are already being stretched by Trumps (often illegal) acts, but it is also an inappropriate display of power emulating dictators of the past.

Tomorrow there will be a nationwide protest to take attention away from his parade and bring it towards the real issues. Trump has repeatedly disobeyed the law, antagonized the innocent, and taken power from the people to put in the hands of his wealthy cronies. We need to bring attention to the evil that lays in his new budget bill coming up, in illegally taking a state's national guard to try stirring up violence, and in the many other things he has done.

Protest has worked in the past and will be our best weapon short of completely removing him by force. It has saved medical coverage for many, improved gun safety, given workers more of their rights back, and improved climate change / global warming awareness.  

Trump and his followers are afraid, he has [threatened all who protest](https://newrepublic.com/post/196672/trump-issues-threat-parade-protesters-no-kings). It shows how much power a protest can have. 

Check out the [No Kings Day website](https://www.nokings.org/) to see what protests are in your area if you live in the United States. If you don't live in the U.S., know that people are protesting and fighting out here, even when the media suppresses it.
