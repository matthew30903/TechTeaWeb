description: A lot has happened this month. Lets go over what has been going on in my world and share some fun links. 
---

This has been a wild month. I celebrated my 30th birthday with my partner, learned more about Nix and NixOS, and the US government continues to speed run the destruction of civil liberty.

## US Politics

I know, no one wants to read about politics or my opinion on the matter, but I do have thoughts.

ICE has become the Republican's private army. Random raids are happening often out here in Los Angeles, ICE are armed and have shown they do not care about probable cause. My friends and partner can't leave home without feeling like they have a target on their backs. 

Texas is planning to gerrymander the state even more than it already has been to help shift the House towards the Republicans. Democrats tried to stall it out, but things escalated a lot through the month. It is a complete mess and only getting worse as the news continues to flow. 

Trump also took control over the capital, assuming control over the police and deploying the national guard in DC. A perfect lead up to the midterms.

None of this is new behavior for the Republicans, but the scope is far larger than ever before. 

If you are in a red state or a republican you might be able to sway your representative's opinion. Please let them know you don't stand for these attacks on our liberty. 

## Learning Photography

You may have noticed all my blog posts this month [have been of photos](/photography) I took. My skills are still lacking, but I've been having a lot of fun taking pictures and learning the editing process.

Please take a look at the photos, share your critiques, and suggest any resources to help me improve. Let me know if there are better settings to use for ImageMagick to optimize the photos. 

If you want the full resolution images please let me know.

## Gaming

I didn't dive deep into any new games this month, but I did touch a bunch of them. One of my desires this year is to dive into my hobbies more deeply and gaming is a place I always neglect. This month I sampled some games and also played a lot of Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma.

### Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time (Switch)

I played a large part of the first Fantasy Life game on my 3DS and was very excited to get this new one. Unfortunately, Playasia often has logistics issues so it took a very long time to ship, once shipped it came very quickly though. I played for a few hours before deciding to order a copy for my girlfriend so we could play the rest of the game together. Unfortunately the copy I ordered for her still hasn't shipped and likely won't for a few more weeks. 

The game is vast, cute, and shallow (not in a bad way). It is very accessible and while the systems in the game are not deep, they are very well integrated with each other. The town building mechanic seems to be very well thought out. Crafting is simple and a bit tedious with the minigame, but the game gives players a way to automate the tedium fairly quickly. The big thing going for this game is charm. Every bit of the game is charming and feels like it was made with love. 

I'd say it has an MMO vibe if all the evil business practices were replaced with more depth and love.

### Pokémon Alpha Sapphire (3DS)

My first Pokémon game was Pokémon Emerald on my mom's Game Boy Advance SP. I haven't played much of the series, but saw there was a remake of the gen 3 games and wanted to give it a try. I've only completed two gyms and might not touch the game again for a long time, but it was fun to relive my childhood for a few hours. The game has a lot of quality of life improvements over the originals and is significantly better quality than the newer games in the series.

Pokémon as a series really suffers from the lack of things to do outside of battle. It is a very competent combat RPG series (though on the easy side for the vast majority of the campaign) and has a lot of potential that will likely never be realized as the games will sell no matter the quality. This game has a bit more going in it outside of battle than the newest entries with Pokémon contests and secret bases (one of my favorite features in the series I wish would make a comeback), but my criticism still stands.

Unfortunately Omega Ruby (the sister game to this one) did not grip my girlfriend nearly as much as the newer games. She got frustrated over some of the more archaic aspects of the games and quit playing. Without her there is not much motivating me to play Pokémon games. She is a recent Pokémon fan and completed Legends Arceus 100% (an absolutely crazy feat, I can't even complete some of my favorite games). 

### RimWorld (PC)

RimWorld should be a perfect game for me. Base building, emergent gameplay systems, lots of mechanics to tinker with, etc. Unfortunately I did not have much time to put into it after a few hours. This is one I'm going to jump into in the future.

I liked what I've played of the game so far. The UI seemed buggy for me, but that might be because I'm on Wayland, xWayland should have taken care of that though. I'll share some thoughts if I ever get back into it.

## Links:

I didn't do much link collecting this month. I'm very far behind on my RSS feed. Give me a few months to get through everyone else's great articles, videos, and projects. I'll have more links than anyone could ever want by then. At least the internet's death is still only a hallucination of the corporate web.

### Articles

Terence Eden talks about [a very bad experience with using Matrix for chat rooms](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/im-never-going-back-to-matrix/). For those who don't know, Matrix is an open source protocol for chats. The clients often look like Discord, Slack, and Microsoft Teams and are designed to work in a similar manner, but the rooms and chats are encrypted and decentralized. The problems are Matix has been half-baked for a long time, there is a spam issue, and the team behind it aren't always the best at PR. I've tried using Matrix a few times, but for all its promises the clients that implement it haven't delivered. It is tech I'm still hopeful for, but Wayland will be feature complete before Matrix is usable state for the lay person.

Wouter wrote something that really strikes home, the [horrors of working on corporate software and how awful most of it is](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/08/on-being-haunted-by-my-corporate-software-past/). Before doing tech support and non-dev IT work, I was a developer on a large project for the company I worked for at the time. It was a government contract to help improve the California welfare software and integrate the three systems being used across the state. The software was confusing and sucked to use. Now I work on the support side for software my current employer makes as well as helping other people use that software with their own medical software. Our software is not terrible in comparison to all the other medical software I have to interact with, but UX is not great either. The real terrible thing is the software running on the medical imaging devices (we don't make that fortunately so no shame for this one), I've never heard an x-ray or ultrasound tech praise their imaging software. Usually we get calls in because something failed and it is not on our end, but with the software that is shooting x-rays all over the room the tech is standing in. For my job we also use the standard corporate software from companies like Microsoft and I can safely say the software is horrible. Anyone who complains about open source software having bad UX or being unstable should try using a commercial product instead, it only gets worse. Kdenlive might crash once in a while, but it is still more stable than adobe premier and it doesn't cost a monthly subscription.

Emmet [wrote blog posts and recorded videos for a very useful set of guides to NixOS](https://librephoenix.com/tags/nixos.html). I've been using NixOS for a while now, but by no means understand the system well. Emmet has helped a lot with my understanding of NixOS. My configuration improvements were spawned from his videos and blog posts.

Ruben Verweij talks about the [complex task of organizing feeds and how using permaculture zoning principles helped him organize them](https://kedara.eu/organising-feeds-permaculture). I really like this idea and am likely going to start using it for my feeds as well. Currently, I organize my feeds by what they are (personal blogs, projects, news, etc.) and that works to a degree, but I always end up with a large list of unread blog posts from people I enjoy reading. Awesome idea and thank you for sharing Ruben.

### Videos

Extra Credits goes over the issues' consolation, complex supply chains, stagnating wages, and the failure of the current U.S. administration to understand basic economics has [endangered the board game industry in the United States and likely the rest of the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BRLn2Ii4Rc). The issues aren't limited to board games of course, but it is a good example of how entertainment is becoming unfeasible for people to buy or produce. 

Radu from 1kwords talks about [why he photographs the downtrodden and 'undesirables' in society](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUTZ7_-cMGI). He photographs himself through others. He lived a rough life and eventually got out of that rough life. His photos respect and acknowledge that people live the same rough life he has in the past. He acknowledges the reality of it. His thoughts are worth listening to. Many people suffer homelessness and addiction around the world, but many would like to forget them. Radu captures their reality in photos. 

Tezumi goes over [the history, use, and care of tetsubin kettles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wzICVgKo2s&pp=0gcJCccJAYcqIYzv). There is a wealth of information in here if you are interested in using a cast iron kettle for heating water in general. I will stick to my electric kettle, but if I had room for one I'd get a tetsubin.

Polymatt [made a floppy disk from scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBiFGhnXsh8). It is a really cool and interesting project and makes me want a CNC milling machine all the more. Floppy disks are obsolete tech, but there are still places that use them and the tactile feel of them cannot be beat. I hope to see people take this further in the future with making their own disks. 

Framing Logic [tears apart an argument against Atheism that Jordan Peterson used during a debate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jCSmBWpk6FE&pp=ugUHEgVlbi1VUw%3D%3D) while also teaching people how to identify bad arguments. If you don't know who Peterson is, you are very lucky. Peterson is a popular right wing media personality and pseudo-intellectual who is known for manipulative and vague arguments for whatever he is in favor of at the moment. Recently he went on a debate show (that is also pretty manipulative from everything I've seen) and was supposedly representing Christianity. The whole time he refused to actually engage in the debate, define any terms he was using, etc. The really sad thing is Peterson's early career (while by no means good) did have some positive impact on some people's lives. Before being a far right talking head he was still right wing and manipulative, but he did preach a message about self-actualization that resinated with and helped some people out of ruts in their lives. Now he just focuses on 'owning the libs' and being 'anti-woke', whatever that means.

Ben [made a camera robot using an old 3D Printer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qk4X3khyoXI). This is an awesome project. It isn't really anything new, but the execution is great. It would be a lot of fun to have a camera robot or slider.

Dr. Justin Sledge of Esoterica discusses [the processes and history of alchemy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv6t6tvuqCg). Alchemy is very interesting and it is nice to see someone exploring it from an academic view on YouTube. I've honestly not watched enough of Dr. Sledge's videos, but they are always interesting dives into the more mystical side of religion and philosophy. I highly recommend taking a look. 

Rosencreutz talks about the [history of sea shanties](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_AtJX2LJpkk) and their place in the video game series Assassin's Creed. Sea shanties are interesting and honestly we need more work songs in the modern time. Where is my song about the thankless job of making sure users pressed the power button on their monitors? As an aside: while I don't like the Assassin's Creed games very much and absolutely hate Ubisoft as a company and publisher, the games are very interesting from a historical fiction standpoint. 

MMqd recommends that hobbyist game developers make [systems rather than small games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPuIysZxXwM). Many game developers on YouTube and in general suggest people start learning game development by building small games before tackling their dream project. The problem MMqd sees with this advice is people are going to be less likely to complete these projects and these projects don't contribute directly to the dream game that motivates a lot of people to learn game development in the first place. Instead, he recommends people build the systems they need for their dream game in self-contained ways so each project they complete contributes to their dream game. I like this way of working and is how I've been working on my RPG Maker game. I still think it can be helpful to complete small projects, but making systems that contribute to an overall goal is a lot more fun and motivating. If you are struggling to learn game design or programming in general, it might be helpful to go with this approach if the normal project based learning approach recommended by many is not working. Find a small project you can work on that can eventually be wrapped into your overall bigger project, you might find yourself being a lot more productive.


Benn Jordan talks about the [mass surveillance industry in the United States and the problems with AI traffic cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pp9MwZkHiMQ). This video is dense, but very informative. I highly recommend this video. I'm fairly outspoken about the need for privacy, but it is hard when everyone is selling your data to everyone else and no laws protect you. We need to undermine and fight technology and policies that allow for mass surveillance at every turn. Traffic cameras save lives and are genuinely a good thing overall, but when they are tied to a database that tracks everyone's every move we have a duty to fight against them.

How Money Works goes over [the AI bubble and how it is wrecking our economy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwD9EnCzujM). I am always critical of how companies market AI as a replacement to human creativity and critical thinking, but I've also talked at length about the cost AI has placed on the average person. AI companies will bleed us dry and we will not see the fabled benefits they speak of. In any case, watch this or any other video from How Money Works if you need another reason to be depressed about the effects of unregulated capitalism. 

Bread from Bread on Penguins talks about [how she composes her photos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VZJNvNKpucE). She goes over a lot of small tips that I hope to implement in my photography. Her channel is awesome if you haven't already subscribed. 

## To Another Month

The world is a scary place right now, but we can't let that get in the way of enjoying life while we still can. I hope you enjoy the links and my photos this month.

September is going to be another month of photography and learning. I'm going to see if the local library has some books on photography and hopefully learn something new. Unfortunately all the photography classes offered by the local colleges out here are during the hours I work. I'll jump on a weekend class if one is offered in the future.

I hope the political situation calms down, but that is wishful thinking. It is likely we will need a series of controlled wildfires in DC to restore a healthy climate to the country.

With AI, dumb politics, wars, and all the other dreadful stuff going on it is hard to stay positive, but the world is a beautiful place if we look closely. We have the power to change things for the better and we can fight. Lets all work together and do what we can to make the world a better place.
