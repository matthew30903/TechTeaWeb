description: A lot has happened this month. Lets go over what has been going on in my world and share some fun links. 
---

This month was a bit busy, but I finally found time to create a photo gallery template for [Hugo](/articles/2025/website-update-photo-gallery/). You can find my photos on my [photography page](/photography/). This was a long time coming and I still don't have everything dialed in, but I got a camera back in April and I want to use it. Please give some feedback on the photos. As someone who is still learning/getting back into, I can always use a tip or two.

There is a lot of stuff going on this month, seems to be a trend this year, that has taken up my mental willpower and energy. My main vice, YouTube, has taken way too much of my free time. Really need to direct that towards more mindful consumption and more creation. 

A major highlight was going to Chinatown with one of my best friends. I've lived in Los Angeles for years and haven't been till now. Got some good tea from a gongfu style tea place and took lots of photos. I'll upload the photos once I have time to go through all of them.

### News

#### Google's AI is Spying on Private Communications

Another reason to hate generative AI popped up. If you have an android phone some models will get an update that gives Google's AI access to your apps. This violates your privacy and the privacy of the people you talk to. Even if you think this is a useful feature your contacts might not. Privacy is important. I don't know about you, but I don't want a shady AI company looking at all my messages and other activities. Both [Tuta](https://tuta.com/blog/how-to-disable-gemini-on-android) and [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/security/2025/07/unless-users-take-action-android-will-let-gemini-access-third-party-apps/) reported on this. Fortunately with a little tech knowhow (explained in the articles) you can disable this, at least for now.

#### Collective Shout and Payment Processors Censor Games

Via [Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/once-a-relative-haven-for-adult-games-itch-io-begins-removing-explicit-titles/), [Eurogamer](https://www.eurogamer.net/we-approached-payment-processors-because-steam-did-not-respond-australian-pressure-group-collective-shout-claims-responsibility-for-steam-and-itchio-nsfw-game-removal), and [PC Gamer](https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/itch-io-is-actively-reaching-out-to-other-payment-processors-after-pressure-from-credit-card-companies-to-curtail-nsfw-content-and-that-compared-to-valve-it-has-limited-ability-to-push-back/).

Mastercard and Visa were pushed by the Australian anti-free speech non-profit Collective Shout to increase their censorship of adult content in video games and other media. This lead to game published on Steam and Itch.io to be either removed or delisted. It doesn't matter if you don't like adult content in games, payment processors should not be the ones to decide what consenting adults make, see, or consume. I'm against exploitation and they should get the proper authorities involved when it comes to stopping that, but this is just people writing, reading, and playing erotica. The only ones who were harmed were the sensibilities of people who hate anything they don't understand and are unwilling to see any nuance. 

If you are in the United States, there is a [change.org](https://www.change.org/p/tell-mastercard-visa-activist-groups-stop-controlling-what-we-can-watch-read-or-play) and an [ACLU](https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy) petitions to sign if you wish to fight against this. There is also a bill that was introduced to [limit payment processors and banks from regulating the markets](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/senate-bill/401) like this, though I don't know what the real impact would be if it gets passed and I'm always skeptical at what this government will do. 

To be fair to Collective Shout, this time around they were targeting games that protrade sexual violence. This is still not something payment processors should be deciding and should be handled by the law (assuming it is illegal), but it could be argued their intentions were good. The road to hell is paved with good intentions, though I doubt Collective Shout has ever had truly good intentions considering their history.   

Remember, this isn't about adult games. This is about payment processors deciding what people are allowed to interact with.

### Cool Projects

[Rapid Photo Downloader](https://github.com/damonlynch/rapid-photo-downloader) is a cool little tool that lets you define rules for downloading your photos off an external device. I was copying my photos into a folder on my computer and then lettings [Phockup](https://github.com/ivandokov/phockup) do the work of sorting them into folders, but this tool has a much less unfortunate name and a much more comprehensive set of filtering features to help copy images into the correct folder and with the correct name. The project isn't as maintained as it used to be due to the maintainer's illness, but nevertheless it is an awesome project and could use some support. 

### Articles

Ruben Schade has, rightfully, [removed Creative Commons licensing from his website](https://rubenerd.com/ceasing-my-use-of-creative-commons/) after the organization sold out to AI slop generators and lazy capitalists. It saddens me that something so good for society (a copyleft set of licenses embracing open culture) being (predictably) used to do the exact opposite of its original mission. It is not surprising in the least, gen AI is one of the most morally bankrupt things in the tech industry right now, but it is very sad nevertheless. 

Leilukin [fully switched over to Linux recently](https://leilukin.com/blog/posts/2025-06-27-migrate-linux-full-time/) after playing around with it for years and dual-booting. It is always nice to see someone gain some freedom over their computing. While not everyone takes to Linux like Leilukin did, I do believe it is worthwhile for everyone who uses a computer to at least try it a few times once in a while. Linux might not be for everybody, but it is better than Windows (a system made for nobody) and Mac (a system made for only a select few). Hope Leilukin will stick with an open source OS for the long term, it isn't an easy transition, but it is worth it.

Iris Meredith proposes we fight big tech and all the stuff that comes with it by being [vulgar (unfiltered and critical), horny (understanding our own desires), and threatening (ideologically, though Italian plumbers work too)](https://deadsimpletech.com/blog/vulgar_horny_threatening). I'm generally not aggressive nor am I prone to vulgarity in private or online life, but there is no arguing that Iris is onto something with this article. Highly recommend reading this one. 

Xe Iaso created the Anubis project to help stop AI scrapers. A noble task indeed. Unfortunately development costs money and thus, Xe needs a way to generate revenue. That is where a paid version comes in. People have complained about the anime character mascot for the software, the [paid version doesn't have that branding and thus the anime character became a way to help prevent burnout](https://xeiaso.net/blog/2025/avoiding-becoming-peg-dependency/). Two things sadden me about this; One (1) projects don't get enough support even when they become widely used (a natural side effect of capitalism and its parasitic relationship with labor), and Two (2) the corporate world has sucked so much fun out of computers that people are upset and offended by an anime character being on the screen for a second or two. Computers should be fun as should all tools, don't let some suits take away that fun. 

R. Tyler Croy asks a question that all workers should be asking "[if we are expecting an improvement to productivity gains what percentage of those gains will workers see reflected in their compensation](https://brokenco.de/2025/06/23/the-means-of-production.html)"? Now the truth is AI is generative unlikely to actually produce true long-term gains in its current form (even if the code works you need people who understand it to maintain it), but let's say it did improve productivity 50%. Will workers get a 50% raise? No, not likely. What about 25%? Also, unlikely. It is unlikely workers will see any long-term benefit because the capitalist class don't share profits. Instead, we will likely see the number of jobs shrink and wages stagnate and eventually decrease. This is what happened during the industrial revolution, and it is what has been happening since Reagan, why should AI change anything for the better? 

R. Tyler Cory also wrote a nice little note about [how you can execute code/shell commands in Newsboat's urls file](https://brokenco.de/2020/07/07/newsboat-wacky-feeds.html). This is very useful when a website doesn't return an RSS feed over HTTP or you need to run a script to convert it into an RSS feed. Basically with the right nohow you can pull just about anything into Newsboat. I personally don't have a use for this right now, but in the future I might so it is a good thing to remember. 

At the start of the year Robb Knight started journalling regularly. He wrote an [awesome update post](https://rknight.me/blog/five-months-of-journalling/#fnref1) explaining how his journal practice has evolved over the 5 months he has been at it. I absolutely love seeing how people work and Robb Knight goes through a lot of how he uses his journal, what worked from the Bullet Journal Method and what doesn't work.

Stefan Bohacek gives [thoughts on generative AI](https://stefanbohacek.com/blog/on-generative-ai/) that I pretty much agree with. As long as generative AI exists in its current form or as long as the motives behind it don't change, it will never be worth it.

Roy Tang muses about how [the web is not dead and is still a place to be explored](https://roytang.net/2025/06/web-explorer/). AI crawlers and capitalism aren't competing with the indie web, they are killing the current monetization model of the web. While I agree that the indie/small/etc web will always be here and alway be more interesting than the corporate web, it is also true that capitalism is putting pressure on all of us (AI sucking up our bandwidth, legislation being passed that increases our overhead all because bad actors can't behave, etc.). I still think we need to fight against negative change; but also the internet is not dead, it is just most people don't know how to access it.

Drew DeVault talks about the recent drama [regarding X.org and a fork made by a right wing extremist/conspiracy theorist](https://drewdevault.com/2025/06/30/Speak-the-truth.html). Basically a X maintainer was working on patches for the dying display server and decided he didn't like that Freedesktop is run by people who believe everyone has the basic right to live freely. There is some nuance to it, but really it boils down to that when you strip away the rhetoric. In any case, Drew doesn't really get into the weeds about what happened, but instead shares two kinds of responses to the new X fork. One is polite, but not effective nor does it get to the point. The other is blunt and gets to the heart of the matter. Anyone who is complaining about 'wokeness' or DEI is either a useful idiot for the right or out right malicious. There should be no tolerance for these kinds of people in any space, especially one built around software freedom. Drew seems to agree with what Iris Meredith was talking about in her article. I have my own thoughts about these kinds of people for a future article. 

Kev Quirk has been slowly [changing his relationship with technology](https://kevquirk.com/blog/out-with-old-tech-in-with-the-new). He ditched apple, cut back on his phone use, and canceled his subscriptions to YouTube and Kagi. It is nice to hear that he also found Ubuntu serving his needs on the Framework laptop. Deliberate and mindful use of tech is how we break free from the abusive behavior of big tech.

Simone talks about [the tech changes he has made to improve his life as well as things he already did that were helpful](https://minutestomidnight.co.uk/blog/changes/). Similar to Kev he has been taking a very mindful approach to tech. He has switched to Linux, decentralized his phone, and overall reduced his dependence on abusive tech. He also talks about recognizing when old ways were objectively better (i.e. tech understood consent back then) and why retro computing is gaining popularity.

Terence Eden has some thoughts about how many of us [share and interact with files on a computer](https://shkspr.mobi/blog/2025/07/weve-got-to-stop-sending-files-to-each-other/). He doesn't think we should be sending copies of living documents to each other now that collaborative tools exist and are omnipresent in our tech lives. I mostly agree with him, but I also don't think we should abstract away what is happening in the background and unfortunately that is what most tools that allow collaborative workflows do. The other issue is a lot of these collaborative tools are proprietary and tied to abusive business practices. If we could all agree to use NextCloud (with their federation stuff enabled) or compatible tools then that would be great.  

Matthew talks about how [personal website operators owe nothing to anyone](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/you-owe-nothing/index.html). I'm fortunately a small dot in the already small personal web sphere, so I'm not sent too much abuse, but man are people entitled on the internet. Remember folks, your website is yours and as long as you are not breaking any laws or selling something to customers you owe it to yourself to not feed the entitled kids who act like you owe them.

Wouter Groeneveld talks about his [experience with using a LLM for pair programming](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/07/pair-programming-with-chatgpt-an-experience-report/). His situation is an interesting one in that he had little outside resources and no experience with the frameworks he needed to work with. The AI was predictably unreliable, but good enough to use as a last resort to figure out what he needed to do. Wouter already had enough knowledge to use and correct the flaws with the AI and has a measured approach to using it, but I feel many people would be doing themselves a grave disservice using LLMS for programming. The other takeaway is that we need more good documentation so people don't need to resort to LLMs as much and when they do, they have a good point of reference to find the flaws in the LLM's code. As long as AI code tools are prone to hallucinations, they are not much use for serious tasks except rare edge cases. Unless you are already knowledgeable enough about a subject that you normally wouldn't need one, AI is a liability that will give you flawed information you won't be able to detect or understand.

Minsuk Kang also [shares his experience with using AI](https://kangminsuk.com/blog/gpt-plus/). He used it as a reading companion to help him understand what he was reading. The problems with it showed their ugly heads though and it clearly was taking away more than it was giving, at least at the moment. I have a bias towards personal agency and his story reads of horror that makes my skin crawl. The idea of differing reading, something I do for fun and to learn, to a bot terrifies me. I do understand the utility of the tech, but at the same time if at all possible I think a dictionary and research will have a better long term effect. Intentionality over convenience. 

He also wrote a post [about writing in English and his fears for South Korea's future](https://kangminsuk.com/blog/write-for-the-americans/). I cannot relate nearly as much for I have not experienced this situation myself, but I can feel the fear and pain in his writing. The idea of cultural erasure has been strong in my mind for a long time. It is a devastating thing. It is beautiful that Korean culture exists as much as it does abroad, but the idea that the whole country could be gone in a generation or two due to low birthrates is a terrifying reality for many post-industrial nations and Korea is leading the trend. That is not to say I'd ever endorse programs that force an increase in birth rates (no one owes it to anyone else to have kids), but it is a reality that exists. I do hope Minsuk Kang continues to write in English, a lot of his writing is powerful, but I also understand that there is a lot going on. 

### Videos

Benn Jordan [showcases the amazing vocal abilities of several bird species](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCQCP-5g5bo), he even got a starling to play a sound that stored an image. He got a bird to store data in a resolution that was readable on a computer. Really amazing what birds can do and Benn's audio skills are amazing too. He has recommendations for how to collect bird sounds and where to find datasets on birds. 

1kwords discusses his [photo and video workflow on Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1OZJPN3KF8). Unless you are a professional working collaboratively, there is generally no reason other than skill/time commitment to use Adobe software in the photo/video space nowadays. Not only that, but there is professional and open source software that can do almost anything a photographer/videographer would need to do that runs on Linux. 1kwords use of Linux is pragmatic rather than ideological and that is what people need to see, you can use Linux for creative work.

Inkbox [built a keyboard with a screen for displaying legends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hqKPu2BEkI0). This is a very bad keyboard, but a really cool project. There are products that try to do things similar to this, hall effect key switches and the screen for displaying legends, but I doubt any of them on the market are full sized keyboards like this one. While I don't think it is practical or necessarily useful (keyboard layers are a thing and even if you keyboard doesn't support custom layers there are tools to do it on a software level), this is something I've thought about making more than once myself.

Polymatt [restored and modded an 80s CRT monitor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xYQU5SldcA). It is really amazing seeing his many different skills all come together to make something awesome. 

Miles made a [bed frame with an LED based alarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mXvW_So_eI). This is a great functional project. His channel is new to me, but he has a lot of skill. The visual presentation is amazing as is the project.

Evan Monsma reminds us that with the right equipment you can use any battery with anything. [He used his 20V tool batteries on his Sony cameras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wp_qrcev4rc). It is a cool project and apparently modern Sony cameras have a recording limit of 13 hours, much better than the 30-minute limit on my old camera before I got the Sony A6700. You probably don't want to convert power tool batteries to work with expensive cameras, there is a chance of breaking things. That said this is a project that really makes me happy to see.

Joseph from Five Duck Studio gives [tips for using wood screws and what wood screws are best for the majority of projects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SMYbr93rsCE&pp=ugUEEgJlbg%3D%3D). While some of it may look like common sense, he is providing valuable knowledge for anyone who needs to combine an object to a piece of wood.

## To Another Month

This month was full of stuff going on in the world. I did read a lot and played some Rune Factory, but the Chinatown visit was the main thing of note. Over the next few months I'm going to focus on improving my photography skills and hopefully spend less time on YouTube.

Hope you enjoy these updates. Remember my inbox is always open and have a great August.
