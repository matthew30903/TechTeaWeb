Update: Wouter shared his [stationery drawers](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/02/my-stationary-drawers/) in response to this post. Please share yours as well.

While I'm not the biggest fan of consumerism I do love to see how people work. This often leads me down a rabbit hole looking at how people setup their offices, how they organize their drawers, and what things they have that improve their lives. I was thinking of doing one of those desk tour videos that I sometimes see on YouTube, but my desk is a mess. Instead I'll go over something that is near and dear to me, the stationery drawer under my desk.

## Stationery

{{< figure src="./img/stationery_drawer" alt="Image: My stationery drawer.">}}

I love pens, paper, and the tactile feel of writing things by hand so stationery items make up a large section of this drawer. 

### Writing Implements

I've got more than a few pens, some markers, and a mechanical pencil laying around. In the order of most used to least here we go:

1. Pilot Custom 74 Fountain Pen in Teal with an EF nib - I love this pen. This is my first gold nib fountain pen and it writes like a dream. I write small so a Japanese EF nib is perfect. No idea how it compares to other gold nib pens in the long run as this is my first and I don't plan to collect many pens in the future, but it is an awesome pen. 
2. Pilot Metropolitan Fountain Pen in Black with a F nib - I had a Kaweco Sport before this, but it was the Metropolitan that made me really fall in love with writing by hand. I've had two other Metropolitans before this one, but I lost the cap to one and the other fell out of my pocket on the bus one day. 
3. Tombow ABT 990 Brush Marker - I use this as a highlighter for books. The soft brown is significantly easier on the eyes than traditional highlighters, but still stands out enough to get the job done. I honestly forget where I learned about this one.
4. Pilot G2 Pen with a .38 mm tip - I hardly use anything other than a fountain pen for writing, but every once in a while I need a gel roller to write on something that isn't as compatible with fountain pen ink. Probably not the best gel pen ever, but it was my first pen that wasn't absolutely awful to write with (as it was for many people).
5. Uni Kuru Toga Roulette Mechanical Pencil in Gun Metallic with a .5 mm tip - Back when I was in college I had a lot of math classes and needed a reliable pencil. I would often break my led and I hated the fact that I had to constantly readjust my pencil when writing to keep it sharp. The Kuru Toga fixed a lot of my problems simply by auto rotating the led as I wrote. I don't really use pencils for much anymore, but I have been using this one to underline things in books where highlighting won't do.
6. Fine Point Black Sharpy Marker - This is something I don't use very often now that I have a label maker. I used to use this with some blue painter's tape to label things. My girlfriend still uses Sharpy markers for things, but she has her own so this little one just sits in a Gridfinity ben hidden under the one holding my other writing tools. 

I don't really cary much else to write with in here. In the future I'd love to get a fountain pen with a flex nib and maybe a glass dip pen, but they aren't really needed.

### Things to Write On

All the pens in the world are useless without something to write on. I'll use the same principles as before for ordering.

1. Leuchtturm1917 A5 Notebooks - This is my go to notebook for most of my writing. I've used Leuchtturm notebooks for a long time. Their paper is consistently good, they have small details that make using and storing them wonderful, and overall are just a good product. I use A5 notebooks because their compact enough to carry with me without being so small that it is hard to write in. I used to use their A6 notebooks for my journal before the current one I'm using. I have both lined and dot grid, but I'll probably be using dot grid for everything in the future.
2. Midori MD Notebook A7 Blank - I've been using this for recording the fountain pen ink I use. After getting a bunch of ink samples I needed a place to record them. The paper dries a little slower than in the Leuchtturm, but the ink hasn't bleed through the pages so far. If I end up liking the paper I might get a larger notebook once my current A5 notebook is full.
3. Post-It Sticky Notes - I used to use these all the time, but I've switched to using a bullet journal for idea capture so have not really been using them much. Most often these get folded onto themselves to make a bookmark for whatever book I'm currently reading.

Not pictured here is a Moleskine softcover mini pocket notebook. My wallet has flap to store one along side a fisher space pen. Don't really like how the space pen writes and Moleskine's paper quality leaves a lot to be desired, but they are always with me even when my A5 notebook is not. 

### Fountain Pen Stuff

I've got a bunch of pen inks, an Ink Miser Ink-Shot Inkwell, and some syringes for the pens. 

My favorite inks so far have been Diamine Dragon's Blood, Diamine Polar Glow, and Jacques Herbin 1670 Emerald of Chivor. I got this [ink sample set from Goulet Pens](https://www.gouletpens.com/products/best-sellers-ink-sample-set) that I'm slowly working through and hope to have more favorite inks to come. Might write about them in the future.

### Other stuff

I have some generic D1 labels for my DYMO Label Manager 280. The first party labels are expensive and the generic ones are just as good.

I got a sheet of sticky tabs to bookmark important parts of a book for later reflecting/quoting, but I've hardly been using them.

## Organizer: [Gridfinity](https://gridfinity.xyz) by [Zach Freedman](https://www.youtube.com/@ZackFreedman/videos)

My drawer would be a lot messier if I didn't have some way to organize it. Fortunately 3D printing is here to make life easier.

Zach Freedman's Gridfinity is one of the best system for small part organizers. It is a system of modular bins that fit onto a grid baseplate. As the design is open source you can find a part that will fit almost anything.

Due to Gridfinity's open source nature I didn't get everything from one creator. I'll try to link to everything I have in the drawer.

### [Gridfinity Rebuilt in OpenSCAD](https://github.com/kennetek/gridfinity-rebuilt-openscad)

Most of the bins in the drawer and the entire baseplate were created using this OpenSCAD project. This makes it easy to generate custom parts for just about anything you need without CAD knowledge. Unless otherwise stated the 3d mofels were created using this tool.

### [Gridfinity SD Card Holder (Actually Good Edition)](https://www.printables.com/model/262308-gridfinity-sd-card-holder-actually-good-edition) by dswinton

Simple and does what it says, holds SD cards and holds them well. I don't often user SD cards these days, but I do have some single board computers laying around that use them and a camera I've been meaning to use more often. The SD cards have a nice home.

### Gridfinity USB/Micro SD Card Holder

All the USB sticks I have are dead and need to be replaced, but this is where they sit and the replacements will sit when they do get replaced. In there I have a few USB sticks and Male USB C to Male USB A converters. Nothing too fancy.

### [Gridfinity Ink Sample Storage (parametric)](https://svelte.printables.com/model/998778-gridfinity-ink-sample-storage-parametric) by HofLabs

I had a bunch of ink samples laying around in the box they came in. Fortunately HofLabs made a gridfinity model that easily stored all of them.

## That is My Stationery Drawer

Some might argue that I could use a computer to replace most of the paper focused products in this drawer. They are not entirely wrong, but that is like saying a jpeg at 25% quality is the same as the full resolution raw from a camera. I've tried digital note taking, there are perks to it, but it loses a lot of the flexibility that comes from writing by hand. There is [evidence](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1219945/full) that writing by hand improves learning and thinking. There is also the subjective component, fountain pens and good paper feel nice to write on

I'm not going to say digital writing is bad, most of my blog posts start life as a markdown file and never touch paper. For note taking and more freeform thought the closest thing I've gotten to the flexibility of paper is Logseq, but I've had a hard time getting it to stick outside of work.

In any case, if you have recommendations for my next pen, paper, or some other tool that can make stationery all the more fun and useful please let me know.

If you want to share your workspace or your stationary items please send me a link to a writeup or video on it.
