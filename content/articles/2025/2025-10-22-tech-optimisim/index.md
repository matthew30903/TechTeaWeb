description: Tech isn't all Doom and Gloom, from Open Source to 3D Printing there is a lot of hope for the future.
---

Tech enthusiasts and really anyone with hobbies have had it rough over the last couple of decades. We got to see the creation of amazing technologies and their misuse by techbro capitalists in real time. It is easy to be jaded when you have to see a technology with the infinite creative potential of the web become 3 major websites where people struggle to sell everyone else on the latest scam or fad. It is easy to feel defeated when AI slop generators DDoS your website so they can make worse versions of your creations. There is so much wrong with tech and the world as a whole right now, but there are good things too. We shouldn't just feed our negativity bias, we need to look at the amazing things going on in tech right now, how we can preserve them, and how we can make others aware of them.

I've had this article in my drafts folder for a while now (since January), but it always ended up very wordy and didn't really get across the fact that tech really is still just as interesting and wonderful as it was back in the past. I still don't know if I'll get that across, but I really hope it helps you find joy somewhere in the tech dystopia we are living in. We can find optimism, but we wouldn't find it looking at commercial solutions. 

## Open Source

I feel a lot of our dissatisfaction is spawned from the proprietary garbage that tries to rule our lives. For many people life without Google, Apple, or Microsoft is unimaginable. This makes them miserable and resentful. The reality is that most of us can live full lives with modern tech and not have to use the products slapped together by these major companies. This is thanks to the efforts of volunteers working on open source code and hardware. Web browsers, operating systems, hardware, and more are all freely available or available at a reasonable cost for those who know where to look.

### Free Operating Systems and Tools are Good Enough for Most People

Linux and BSD aren't for everyone. They aren't what a lot of people grew up with, they have their quirks (just like Windows and Mac), and not all software works on them (again, just like Windows and Mac). 

That said, most people just use their computer for web browsing and editing documents. Linux fortunately has access to most web browsers and has a robust office suit with Libre Office for most light document tasks, Thunderbird for email, more markdown editors than you can count for writers, and just about any other generalized task will have at least one tool to complete it.

When people do need the proprietary tools from big tech, there is usually a good enough web version of it.

It is not perfect and does require people to learn new tools, but most people aren't using their computer for much more than web browsing. 

We are still lacking in the more specialized software category. A lot of open source software doesn't have the funding that their proprietary cousins have, some fields are so specialized that there aren't alternatives for their Windows only software, etc. There is a feature gap, but it is slowly narrowing as time passes. Not only that, but proprietary software is starting to come back to Linux. We are slowly moving from "Good Enough for Most People" to "Great for Everyone".

Whats more, we are seeing a lot of people realize that they don't need to bend over for Microsoft and Apple anymore. Linux is getting a new generation of users and some of them are even finding new interest in computers as a whole. As more non-techie people start discovering they can use Linux/BSD/etc they can evangelize in a way we never could. This will bring in more generalist users and improve the ecosystem. 

### Gaming

One area that used to keep more generalist computer users from using Linux was that they couldn't play AAA games easily on it. Fortunately Valve and the WINE project have largely fixed that and AAA's apathy for gamers has also moved more gamers towards indie games that are more willing to support Linux. Unless you are someone who plays multiplayer games with abusive anti-cheat software (and likely other abusive business practices) there is a high chance that the game you want to play will play on Linux. 

Emulators have also gotten better over the years so Linux gamers have access to incredibly large gaming libraries going back to the start of digital gaming all the way to the newest games.

It is sad that most games are proprietary, but we are seeing progress on that front as well. The Battle for Wesnoth, 0 A.D., FreeCiv, etc. are all great games. PICO-8 and other fantasy console games are largely source available for people who want to tinker and learn game development. We also have full on open source re-implementations for games like Morrowind (OpenMW). Red Alert (OpenRA), and more. 

That is to say, gaming is largely not a blocker keeping a majority of people from using open source operating systems.

### Funding

Funding is depressing when it comes to open source and non-profits in general. There is not enough people willing to donate money and capitalists only take and never give back. There has been some good news on that front though.

[FreeBSD](https://www.sovereign.tech/tech/freebsd), [Arch Linux](https://www.sovereign.tech/tech/arch-linux-package-management), and [more](https://www.sovereign.tech/tech) have been given large investments from the Sovereign Tech Agency.

Thunderbird and KDE both had successful fundraisers thanks to a change in tactics where they actually let people know that they can donate to the projects.

Money is flowing into FOSS software like never before and that is awesome.

## Independent Tech is Growing

From the independent web movement proving that the death of the internet is greatly exaggerated to affordable manufacturing tools allowing people to create new tech at home we have a growing independent tech sector that is separate from the normal commercial web.

I've already gone on about the [indie web and how to find it before](/articles/2024/surfing-independent-web/) so I won't re-iterate here. The internet lives up to the promise of beauty and independent though shared on many dissimilar platforms. The main issue is helping others find and contribute to it.

### Independent Hardware

Prototyping and making new tech hardware used to be prohibitively expensive for the average person, even if they were lucky enough to get the education needed to do it. 

Nowadays, we have access to consumer friendly and affordable 3D printers, laser cutters, milling machines, and more. Even if you don't have the room or money to get a machine yourself there are build on demand services that will do it for you. 

Even better, a lot of the designs people create are either open source or affordably priced so you can make your own without having to reinvent them all on your own.

### Self-hosting isn't a Solution for Everyone, but it Doesn't Have to be.

Self-hosting is awesome. It lets you use open source or affordably priced closed source software on your own servers you either own or rent. You can replace almost any big tech service you could ever need as a consumer and be better off for it. This of course requires some amount of technical knowledge, not much to get something working, but enough to filter out the less committed to privacy and local control.

Fortunately this is where service providers step in. There are a lot of independent fully hosted solutions either directly from the developers like in the case of [Miniflux](https://miniflux.app/hosting.html) or by partners of the project like the ones [Nextcloud shares on their website](https://nextcloud.com/providers/#simple-signup). Sure, it costs money. People are already paying far too much for subscription services and software, they can finally cancel those subscriptions and help fund truly independent work from people who actually care.

There are also one click installers for many services provided by off the shelf NAS solutions that can be easy purchase from iXsystems and the like. This lowers the bar of entry for running home servers to basically buying a product and reading the instructions.

## Indie Everything

We have the hardware, software, and even communities to be independent of big tech. 

We just need to evangelize a little more and also pay our tithes to independence. 

Being free of big tech is never going to be easy, but we who are more tech literate can make it easier for others who are not. Writing documentation, blogging, sharing our experiences (without being obnoxious), building and funding independent projects, etc. We can show people there is beauty in independent tech that they can be optimistic about.

## Corporate Tech is Here to Stay (for now)

I don't think we could ever get everyone to give up corporate tech. Even if Darktable and GIMP were to match Adobe one to one on features some people would still prefer to give Adobe a monthly subscription. Indie will never have the surface polish that big tech has, even if the actual user experience is better. It is the same with all things, the masses will gravitate towards the simplest and easiest to consume form of things. That is to say, we need to stop worrying about how we get everyone off big tech and how to make the experience easier for those who are willing to go through the steps to enjoy independence.

As we build out more indie solutions big tech will become increasingly relegated to the corporate world and that tech will feel pressure from the independent solutions. More people will see the alternatives and big tech will have to compete on features, price, privacy, and liberty.

Let's focus on our victories and not lament that more people don't use the independent tech or that our crazy uncle thinks AI generated memes 'owning the libs' is the future. If we focus on making our part of the world a little better instead of trying to convince people it is better they will come around eventually. 

## Not all is Gloom

If you keep up with tech news as much as I do (part of my job) you would think it is all doom and gloom, but there are some very beautiful things going on in the world too. Lets take a moment to just enjoy the fact that we have the privilege to enjoy independent tech and share it with others. Not everyone is going to run a degoogled smartphone or use Kdenlive instead of Adobe Premiere, but we can let them know these solutions exist to their problems and show how it solved ours.
