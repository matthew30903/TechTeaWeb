description: A lot has happened this month. Lets go over what has been going on in my world and share some fun links. 
---

This is the first month of the year and it has been a busy one. Helping a friend move, a new administration has taken power in the United States, a new season of anime has started, and I've been trying out new ways to stay organized and mindful.

## Mindfulness

This will probably be turned into a whole article in and of itself, but I'm transitioning my 3 notebook approach that I tried out last year into one notebook, a bullet journal.

I've "tried" something similar to bullet journaling in the past, but never stuck with it nor did I really understand some of the principles that make it work so well for people. Last year I picked up Ryder Carroll's book on the subject (more about that later) and I think I'm going to give it a good try this year. So far I've been constant with my daily log, but I've not done much with the other collections yet. Robb Knight also [mentioned giving it a try](https://rknight.me/blog/biting-the-bullet/) this year.

One of the big things I'm trying to be aware of is my spending and eating habits. I am going to try a [low buy year](https://techtea.io/articles/2025/mindful-consumption/) for my budgeting. I'll categorize things as either I can buy, can't buy, or can buy only under specific conditions rather than budgeting around money directly. My girlfriend is helping me stay accountable so hopefully that helps.

## Books I've Read

I honestly haven't completed books this month, but there are two in progress and near completion that I thought I'd share.

### The Bullet Journal Method by Ryder Carroll

Ryder Carroll created the bullet journal style of journaling. It is built around some key productivity ideas that are fairly obvious, but not so obvious to keep track of. Carroll's idea is simply to write it down, but in a specific way that makes it easy to keep track of.

I love paper notebooks, but always had a hard time keeping track of things because I'm bad at indexing and I'm inconsistent. The bullet journal helps alleviate this by making itself part of daily life, using some basic indexing rules, and having other useful tools for keeping subjects searchable. Overall it is a great system.

I have a major issue with the book however. Carroll writes about how life changing the method is way too much. I'm already sold on your idea and I already have your book, please stop trying to sell it to me again! There are multiple times where he tells a story about how his or some other person's life has been improved or even saved by a bullet journal. Even if these anecdotes are true they do not help me enjoy the book. At best they are annoying and at worse they are poor attempts to emotionally manipulate the reader into using a bullet journal.

I keep reading it though because there is a lot of good advice and other than the bad anecdotes the book isn't patronizing. I'm going to stick with the bullet journal this year and see if it helps with my problems, but if Carroll every does a new version of his book he needs to get rid of the life changing stories or at least tone it down. Most people aren't as patient as I am with books.

### We are Legion (We are Bob) by Dennis E. Taylor

This is a very fun and interesting book. Taylor wrote a very self-indulgent sci-fi story about a man who becomes a self replicating space exploration probe. The book has a very self published feel, the cover is low resolution, and the story is truly silly. All that said it is really fun so far and barring anything truly egregious I'll probably read the whole series.

In light of recent events, some parts of the book are way more relevant than the author probably intended them to be.

I feel like this one will be a safe recommend.

## Video Games

I only got into one game this month and I'm focused on it. That being Star Ocean Second Story R on the Switch. 

This game plays great, has an interesting set of mechanics, and so far has some fun characters (Only have 4 party members so far). This is a game I plan to replay at least once and I might go back and play the rest of the series at some point. I did give the first Star Ocean a try using an emulator a long time back, but my computer time was much more limited and I lost interest. Now is a good time as any to get into some of these older games, especially seeing as they are getting a lot of improvements with remakes coming out.

### Misclatious Stuff

The [End of Term Web Archive](https://eotarchive.org) is an archive of U.S. government websites. These websites have a lot of important data and information. Currently a lot of that data is [being erased by the current administration](https://www.theverge.com/news/604484/donald-trumps-data-purge-has-begun) so projects like this are of vital importance. 

[Unplatform](https://unplatform.fromthesuperhighway.com) from [Ajazz](https://ajazz.neocities.org) is a tool for helping people find their way on the indie web. The website is a collection of recommendations for using RSS, email, personal websites, and independent communities to improve your online life and free yourself from the corporate web. Manu [shared this](https://manuelmoreale.com/sharing-unplatform) on his blog.

[Grumpy Website](https://grumpy.website) posts examples of horrible UIs and UX. It is kinda cute if a bit infuriating to see some of the things that make it by QA.

I learned that the Oxford English Dictionary keeps a list of words they add each month. It turns out that the word "[Boop](https://www.oed.com/information/updates/september-2024/new-word-entries/)" in reference to booping someone's nose and as in the sound of a computer beeping were both added last year. That makes me happy, probably because I'm surrounded by computers that boop and cats that get booped.

Louis Rossman is creating a [consumer rights violation database](https://wiki.rossmanngroup.com/index.php/Mission_statement) on his wiki. He wants to log every company's bad behavior regarding consumer rights. It is a bit depressing, but a noble goal. We could all use a tool that tells us who we can buy products from without suffering from bad practices. 

Byran built his own laptop built around the RK3588 SoC. This is a really impressive project that I thought deserved to be shared. He has a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fks3PBodyiE), [blog post](https://www.byran.ee/posts/creation), and [git repo](https://github.com/Hello9999901/laptop) for the project. Worth checking out. It is not easy to build a laptop, especially nowadays, but he did and it is open source.

Everyone loves esoteric programming languages right? [Tabloid](https://tabloid.vercel.app) is a turing-complete programming language written in the style of clickbait news headlines. It is under the MIT license and on [github](https://github.com/thesephist/tabloid). I will probably never use this, but it is always nice to see more fun programming languages out there. 

### Articles

This is an old one, but back in 2019 Marc Weidenbaum wrote an article encouraging people to "[Bring Out Your Blogs](https://disquiet.com/2019/06/16/word-blog-20th-anniversary-1999/)" instead of just posting on platforms you don't own.

CJ The X wrote [a manifesto for a better internet](https://cjthex.com/what-is-to-be-done/). There is a lot here, but it is a call to action to do something about the current state of the internet, build websites, create solutions, and own what you create. 

Matt talks about [The Joy of the Internet Slow Lane](https://fyr.io/post/the_joy_of_the_internet_slow_lane). Instant gratification and the tech that enables has made it easy to lose ourselves to it. By being somewhere with slow internet Matt was able to force a state where he could be more mindful about his relationship with technology.

rootCompute wrote [I'm Afraid to Die, so I Made a Website](https://read-only.net/posts/2024-08-18-I'm%20Afraid%20to%20Die,%20So%20I%20Made%20A%20Website.html) last year. It is a thoughtful article about a lot that was on their mind at the time and a worthwhile read.

Manu talks about [if he would or wouldn't be blogging](https://manuelmoreale.com/bloggers-at-the-right-time) if he was raised in the world of social media. This is in response to Jatan Mehta's [own post](https://journal.jatan.space/would-you-blog/) where he asks the question.

Cory laments the [platform trap](https://coryd.dev/posts/2025/your-platform-is-a-trap). We all know any platform that is run with a capitalist mindset (shareholders and endless growth above all else) is doomed to become awful to use, yet many of us still use them. Many don't have a choice and those that do often don't know they have a choice. Bandcamp will sell you DRM free music, eBooks can be purchased from [many places online](https://www.tomsguide.com/tablets/e-readers/no-kindle-no-problem-5-places-to-buy-drm-free-e-books), the fediverse is open to all and if you really want to express yourself you can have a website,  GOG will sell you DRM free video games, etc. There are alternatives, but they still suffer from problems: most people don't know it is an option, even if they do they are apathetic enough to not care, and these platforms require compromise in the eyes of the user. It is less convenient and requires a person to exercise agency to use these platforms over the default. The path of least resistance might be miserable, but it is easy. 

Matthew Graybosch goes over [why he doesn't use generative AI in programming or writing](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/why-i-dont-use-ai-particularly-lex/index.html). I agree with most of what he has to say. I do dream of a day where the AI hype dies down and we see open source models trained ethically. Till then they are nothing more than power hungry toys that siphon human creativity to generate more wealth for billionaires. An ideal LLM would be trained on public domain works and would be implemented in a way that helps foster creativity (instead of generating text it could work like advanced grammar and spell check, offer general writing advice, analyze your writing and provide resources from its database for inspiration, etc.). I feel like then I'd be more receptive to it. Right now LLMs "are merely the artistic equivalent of meat grinders" as Matthew puts it.

Max Bock talks about how tech needs to [focus less on "disruptive innovation"](https://mxb.dev/blog/faster-horses/) and more on solving real problems by improving what we already have. A boring tool is good tool, you know what it will do, it doesn't change on you, it is reliable. Computers need to be reliable more than ever seeing that they are shoved into everything nowadays. 

This is a two for one Annie posted an article about [how terrible people can create beautiful art](https://anniemueller.com/posts/when-you-love-something-made-by-a-terrible-person) and the complexity that comes with it. Manu shared this one in his [own post about the subject](https://manuelmoreale.com/awful-people-are-everywhere), where he points out that there is no shame in liking something made by a terrible person. Due to the lack of nuance in our modern world everyone is a terrible person. I don't think Manu is saying that the people who do terrible things aren't worthy of scorn, but that our perspective is off. Thanks to social media a person who makes a bad joke and a person who did something truly terrible are equally evil, the conversations someone had in private are shared without context, and any real discussion about the problems in society is shut down. As a side note, I have no sympathy for people doing what Kôichirô Itô has been accused of, but at the same time it doesn't mean the work he has created has lost value or beauty. 

Ava talks about [how important the things everyone shares on the internet is](https://blog.avas.space/your-presence/) in light of the AI slop the ad driven corporate web spews out. Matthew Graybosch also [shared his thoughts on this post](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/then-i-shall-make-noise/index.html). I will probably write about the subject myself in the future, but I agree with them. Creation is rebellion against the evils of the corporate and sanitized internet.

Another one from Matthew Graybosch, he reminds us that [Substack is a nazi bar](https://starbreaker.org/grimoire/entries/substack-freedom-of-expression-and-tolerance-for-the-intolerant/index.html). The platform has all the issues that social media brings and then throws extra bigotry on top of it. If you write for Substack consider moving to a personal website instead.

Ruben posts about his [drafts folder](https://rubenerd.com/the-current-state-of-my-drafts-folder/) and the anxiety that comes with posting. One of my commitments this year is to stop sitting on my articles for months on end worrying about editing or mistakes. Ruben and Manu have both been inspirations to post more. 

### Videos

Veronica Explains the ```column``` command in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uL7KvRskeog). Such a useful tool that I didn't know about. Hopefully I will get some use out of it.

[Best Way to Organize Electronic Components?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9kQCDN8lkk) by Asyss Complex - Cristian talks about how he stores his electronic components using 3 ring binders, velcro, and some small plastic bags.

[How Realistic is Fallout New Vegas: Old World Blues? The Horrors of American Science!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOowTMKll0s) by Moon Channel - Moony talks about the horrible experiments the U.S. government performed on both U.S. citizens and people across the world. We should always be mindful about the past, the things people are willing to overlook, and the evils those in power are willing to commit to achieve their goals.

Tin Foil Hat built a [segmented display that can retain its value without power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np4NRMKOG6U) using the power of magnets. This one looks very satisfying.

Bread on Penguins shares [her FFMPEG recording/editing workflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yHYH7I4o9s) for her youtube channel. I love trying to make things perfect and often get stuck in editing, but this workflow makes life a lot easier if you are okay with just recording, doing some basic edits, and sending it off to the world. She also included her script in a [git repo](https://github.com/BreadOnPenguins/scripts) for those who want to take a look and edit it.

The Exhausted Programmer gives [An Introduction to Awk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Da6SB3aYqeY). This year I'm trying to become more handy with the commandline so short videos that go over things like this are very useful.

RECESSIM [reverse engineers some smart meters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7sKDRsiy07k) and discusses the problems with closed source code in publicly funded infrastructure. A really good video that covers both how and the why of reverse engineering. 

Ruben [shared](https://rubenerd.com/bad-apple-but-its-a-fluid-simulation/) Sebastian Lague's video where he plays the [Bad Apple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ni13dnAbSA) video on his particle based fluid simulation. Maybe I need to build a database of all the things people have run the video on.


The Gaming Bench goes over the [Egyptian game Seega](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jMJgzeNAcxA). I love seeing the similarities and differences between ancient games. A lot of games use a similar setup, but it is the subtle nuances that make it interesting. 

Elliot Sang talks about [Homelessness in the U.S.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kb7cp21LmqM). Hostile architecture, poor healthcare, and public apathy continue to worsen homelessness in the United States. 

Dan Olson from Folding Ideas goes over the story of [how fake fossilized human foot prints lead to a whole branch of creationist science](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UDXdqqJQPE). When I was younger the pastor of my church at the time was fully sold on the ideals of this particular branch of creationism. One time we spent a few weeks watching [Kent Hovind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Hovind) lectures. Even in my youth I could see how blatantly false it all was, but I wasn't willing to speak out against it (I was much shyer than I am nowadays). 

How is anyone supposed to take religion seriously when apologists make up whole new systems of physics, geology, and anthropology to justify a world view built upon a hoax? I feel like Christian apologists miss the point sometimes, part of faith is having faith in the first place. If you are that desperate to prove it then maybe your faith is just a house built atop of loose sand.

Second Thought talks about [how to form a Union](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHOGRhBkWOE) and why they are useful. Unions are one of the best things you can join to improve your workplace and your take home pay. My workplace is pretty good, but even a good workplace can be made better with a Union. I doubt that most of my coworkers would want to unionize though, things aren't bad and the company is based in a state that hasn't been the most union friendly. If I ever see or hear of one of them wanting to form a Union though I'll be on board and if I see any anti-union propaganda I'll be the first to call it out.

Marta built a [flip calendar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcigLhLNFjw) and talks about how hard it is to turn a bunch of ideas into action. It is a fun and short one. I'll be keeping track of this channel to see what comes of it.

Matt Perillo goes over how he fits his [creative studio into his small New York apartment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_qgq-NVGMk0). It is definitely inspirational. 

f4mi shows how she [poisoned AI with ".ass" subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDFUjqA1s8). She used hidden subtitles filled with garbage text to confuse AI video summarizers. It is a cool trick that won't likely be useful for very long, but I like the spirit of it.

Inkbox started [working on a SNES game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYLJLJkVfLk) and goes through some of Nintendo's design manual for making said game. It is awesome and reminds me that I really should be working on my own game sometime soon. Anyway it is worth taking a look at it.

Addie from EposVox talks about [why they switched to Linux](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RbvmtnWe2cw). He makes the argument that big tech is terrified of the idea of people having agency and Linux is a tool for having agency with technology. He talks about the friction people feel using Linux (or anything new for that mater) being good as it motivates us to learn and understand that thing we are using. With the increase in abstraction and the erosion of user agency people are finding Linux and BSD operating systems more and more appealing. You don't control a Windows, Mac, iOS, or Android device. You simply can't. On Linux you are the one in control and have the possibility of somewhat understanding how your computer works. 

## The New year

This has been a busy and productive month for me. I can't wait to see what else comes from the rest of the year. 

There is still a lot to do on this website and I've started looking into getting Hyperland or another tiling window manager working on my travel laptop. It will be fun to share this journey with you.

If you have anything cool to share, ideas you want me to explore, or just want to chat feel free to send me an [email](mailto:hello@mattlamont.com).
