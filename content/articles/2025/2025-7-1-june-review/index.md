description: A lot has happened this month. Lets go over what has been going on in my world and share some fun links.

This month was a bit busy and I didn't write as much as I'd have liked. Work, world events, and personal life have taken a lot out of me lately.

## No Kings Day

So the President of the United States illegally started using military force on US citizens in my city. Not a great thing. 

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has been kidnapping people (there is no world where you could say these are lawful arrests) from schools and workplaces, breaking into homes without warrants, and generally antagonizing people out here. Naturally this spawned some protests and there were a few isolated situations where people were destroying Waymo self-driving cars (they provide surveillance footage to ICE) and people have blocked highways. Even though LAPD had things under control the President seized control of the national guard (also illegal as it is a state-controlled militia) and deployed them to LA, further escalating things. Trump really wants to argue there is a rebellion going on out here, there is not. Most of LA is just going about their lives and trying to avoid getting harassed by ICE/LAPD. There was a restraining order to tell Trump to call off his illegal actions, but they continue and the restraining order has been repealed.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has further been escalating things by attacking Judges, Lawmakers, and other government officials.

All of this lead to a protest on June 14, 2025, to remind everyone the President is not a King, but an elected official that is beholden to the law. The conservative media has been acting like we are protesting the election of Trump, but we are really protesting the illegal actions he has performed. Trump threatened protesters, and I'm sure some have had some trouble with DHS, but the protests were peaceful, massive across the country, and brought hope that we can actually mobilize in the United States. Trump has already threatened death for traitors and military law could support that, don't expect the National Guard or military to stand up against him.

Sadly the progress that has been made has been undermined by the Supreme Court and all the yes men around Trump. Even if an action is illegal and unjust, the consequences are mostly fines that come out of taxpayer's wallets. If this continues the poorest of us will be sucked dry, the rest of us will constantly fear being disappeared by the government (ICE has already 'deported' some US citizens and permanent residents), and the rich will profit greatly.

We must continue to protest and if things keep going the direction they are we will need to start fighting. My partner is terrified that she will be arrested and deported (she is a natural-born citizen), shops are closing up and workers are disappearing as they go about their daily lives, and here we have Trump acting like he is a savior and his propagandists from trash heaps like Fox News are spreading his lies about LA that are costing people lives. 

If you see an ICE agent: If you can, avoid them. If you can't, demand a warrant that is signed by a judge. If you see someone throwing bricks at them (don't do this, I'm against violence), maybe it is getting to the point where we should look the other way and let nature take its course. At some point we have to fight back (peacefully, but with a strong threat of violence) or they will take away what freedoms we have.

## Games

### Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma (Switch)

Got Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma for the Switch on the 28th, I put in 9 hours (way more than that by the time I published this article) so it is likely doing something good. Rune Factory 4 is one of my favorite games, but 5 was a mess that I dropped early on. Azuma is a spin off that adapts what was good about Rune Factory 4 into a more town management sim direction. No mechanic is particularly deep so far, but they all fit together into a cohesive whole. I just unlocked the Autumn village as the time of this writing so there is still much to see in the game.

Azuma focuses on a mostly dead region of the world where the player needs to revive the gods of each season and build up the respective village around their shrine. Like all Rune Factory games there is farming, simple combat that is well-thought-out, and a bit of life sim elements as you get to know each of the characters. On top of that is a whole town management system where you need to build buildings (that replace the crafting workstations in prior entries) and staff them with villagers to help craft equipment, make money to feed the villagers, and complete quests. The building mechanic did one thing that is obvious, but a lot of games forget on console, it has an overhead grid system for placing objects and managing the farm. If Dragon Quest Builders 2 had that instead of me having to fight with the camera and controller for placement I'd have probably finished it.

In any case, Rune Factory Guardians of Azuma is looking to be my top game this year so far.

### Articles

Jim Nielsen did some [data analysis on the White House's link blog that shares pro-trump propaganda](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2025/links-from-whgov-wire/). While the results aren't surprising considering that it is a propaganda machine, all the usual culprits are represented and none of the critical sources are.   

Manu has a short little story about [how modern licenses are a scam](https://manuelmoreale.com/your-license-is-a-scam). It used to be that when you bought something you either owned it or you at least as good as owned it. Licenses like the car example Manu uses were more of a thing for big industrial equipment. Then almost all software and media became subscription based over the last 20 years, even for consumers. Now even the physical tools we use have DRM on them, need a constant internet connection, and have arbitrary restrictions that you need to pay a reoccurring fee to remove. While Manu's story is supposed to point out how ridiculous licenses are, we will eventually see this kind of thing if we don't stand against it now. Use open source software and hardware where possible, fight for consumer rights, and sail the 7 seas for anything that requires a subscription when it shouldn't. 

Wouter talks about [one of the many joys of PC gaming, mods](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/06/the-pc-does-what-nintendont-modding-games/). You can mod games on consoles, but not nearly as easily so there are fewer tools to do it and fewer mods to play around with. PC gaming is where it is at if you want to customize your experience. There is the unfortunate lack of physicals nowadays, but otherwise you are going to have access to more games and mods to keep them interesting longer than any console will ever provide. Anyway, Wouter shares some awesome mods for some of the games he has played. Hope it inspires more people to give modding and PC gaming a try. He does bring up a valid point though about the time sink that it can be: real life obligations really make it hard to invest into getting a game modded to perfection and a console is mostly plug-in-play, making it the path of least resistance.

Kami posted her thoughts about [AI and self-expression](https://kami.bearblog.dev/ai-kills-self-expression/). I agree with her on this one. The most evil part of AI is that it takes away its user's agency to create things. There is no soul in AI. There are numerous other problems that taint AI generated slop, but the act of taking away someone's agency in an effort to remove the need for human effort and struggle is truly awful. 

Cory Dransfeldt [has tried a lot of email providers and has some recommendations](https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/recommended-email-providers). I currently use my web hosting provider's email service, but have been in the market for a more privacy focused solution. Cory's list makes it a little easier to figure out who to go with when my budget allows for it. Email is something that we all use, it is not something to be trusted to Google, Microsoft, or your ISP. 

Cory also shares his thoughts on the idea of [using chatbots in place of traditional browsers for interacting with the web](https://www.coryd.dev/posts/2025/the-agentic-web-is-nothing-more-than-a-moat). It is an inherently bankrupt idea, something Cory and I seem to agree on. Search is already useless because these companies monetize it and spew out AI slop, now they are offering a solution to the problem they created: Obfuscating the web with more AI generated slop. Every action these AI companies take deliberately takes away agency from their users. I do not want my web browser keeping me away from websites so it can steal their content and spew out a poor simulacrum of it. When gen AI brings something to the table that actually helps humanity and wasn't trained on stolen works I might consider it. Currently, gen AI only serves the lazy and greedy, taking power from everyone else. I will either pay a human to do a task or learn how to do it myself if I cannot. 

### Videos

Ido Agassi shares [an easy way to bind books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOzxWwCCdXU). He had 120 high school students that needed to bind books of varying thicknesses, he resorted to a Japanese stab binding technique that he shares in this video. My girlfriend and I did a similar stab binding in the past when we made a notebook. Ours did not look nearly as nice as this one, but maybe this video will inspire our future projects.

Cinzia DuBois talks about the [importance of public libraries, why book ownership is still a good thing, and how to support public libraries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qgwsYVtzmY). It is no secret that libraries are under attack and closing down around the world. Here in the U.S. we have a lot of libraries, but due to disuse, anti-intellectualism, political attacks from the right, and general underfunding we are facing a slow erosion of them overall. By the same token we are also losing independent bookshops as well. There is no room for elitism in using a library or owning your own private one when libraries, bookshops, and books in general are all under attack.

Concept Bytes built a [robot coffee table that tracks and walks towards people](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJdRR3ml12A). The really cool part of this build is that its movements are stable enough to have stuff on top of the table as it moves. This is a really fun one for sure.

Michael Burns talks about how and why the [Wisecrack YouTube channel died as well as the conflict between profit motive and the underlying Leftist ideology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xENxXCFlOg4) of their content. Anything that is inherently anti-capitalist will struggle in a capitalist system. Art and philosophy are at an inherent disadvantage when it comes to creating money on YouTube or any other major platform because they often criticize the very nature of the platforms they are using. Michael and his colleagues were burned by their employer and that is not surprising, it sucks, but Michael is trying to make his new YouTube channel work even with the disadvantages inherent to the content within his videos. It is true that left leaning content will always have difficulties securing funds in comparison to the more right leaning competition for a number of what should be obvious factors, but it is not impossible. The only thing I fear is that many left leaning channels that make money use shrill and inflammatory rhetoric to gain clicks, making their message weak and the left seem dumb. Hope Michael is able to make it work.  

If you followed my monthly posts for a while you would know that I've been following Steven Bennett's build log on his open source version of the Dyson Solar Cycle lamp. He is getting very close to completing his design and in the [newest build log he goes over how he designed the base](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFcqoMediuU). It is an awesome project and I can't wait to see how it comes together when he is finished.

## To Another Month

Sorry for the lack of links and a heavy political call to action this month. It has been a struggle watching others so beaten down, I had to say something. The way the world is going right now is dark. I don't want to live in fear of the very government that is supposed to protect me, but here we are, critics of Trump are being silenced or at least harassed. The Supreme Court has sided with Trump and congress is full of spineless cowards. The time for a course correction has come and those with the power to correct it are not doing so. There is a very real fear that the United States won't make it out of this in its current form. Maybe it is time to start looking for safer places to live (though I couldn't afford to move).

Hopefully you found some interesting links and are tempted to give Rune Factory a try. I'll try to share more fun links next time. If I don't post though, assume that Trump (or more realistically his goons) is going after small time bloggers who are critical of his actions.
