description: You don't need to buy a new eReader or ditch your kindle to read ebooks from other vendors. Convert them with Calibre instead.
---

In a recent attempt to erode trust in the company, Amazon [removed the ability for people to download their eBooks to their computer](https://www.theverge.com/news/612898/amazon-removing-kindle-book-download-transfer-usb), surprising no one. This essentially makes it so you can't access your eBooks if you have a kindle that doesn't have networking and haven't already backed up your books. 
 
A lot of people are ditching their kindle for another eReader vendor, but that is not a real solution. That just giving in to consumerist conditioning, trading one master for another. You don't need to turn your kindle into e-waste. You can buy ebooks from many places and still put them on your eReader using [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com).

Before we get started I wanted to preface this with the fact that I've never owned a kindle and only have ever used a Kobo, but the principles apply to all eReaders.

## Where to Find eBooks

When looking for eBooks you want them to be DRM free or at least have easy to break DRM. You can find this out by looking at the seller's website or by doing a little research. I will not link to DRM removal tools here. Though I believe in right to ownership, the U.S. government doesn't and I'm not going to risk linking to them here. 

You can get eBooks at quite a few places including the following:

- [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org) - DRM Free and Public domain works. Refined versions of [Project Gutenberg's](https://www.gutenberg.org) releases.
- [StoryBundle](https://storybundle.com) - DRM Free.
- [Smashwords](https://www.smashwords.com) - DRM free.
- [eBooks.com](https://www.ebooks.com/en-us/drm-free/) - DRM agnostic, linked to DRM Free section.
- [HumbleBundle](https://www.humblebundle.com/books) - Book bundles are usually DRM free.
- [Kobo](https://www.kobo.com) - Has DRM, but can be fairly easily removed.
- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/texts) - Their Library isn't what it used to be after the multiple attacks they got from publishers, but they still have a lot of free books worth reading.
- Author's sites - A lot of authors will offer DRM free versions of their eBooks on their websites, it is worth taking a look.

I am only covering places you can get eBooks legally. If you have any more suggestions please send me an email.

## How do I get it onto an eReader

I recommend a tool called [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com). It is an eBook swiss army knife. Today is not an app spotlight about it though so I won't get into all the details. Today we are just going to discuss how to get your books onto your eReader. This works for most eReaders, not just Kindle.

Launch Calibre and follow the first time user setup. Make sure to select your primary eReader correctly so it can select the right formats.

Download your books to your computer. Then import them into Calibre by clicking the **Add Books** button, then navigate to where you downloaded your books.

You will see them populate in the books list. Click on the one you want and you can either convert it or send it to your eReader using the buttons on the tool bar at the top of the screen. When you send the ebook it will automatically convert it to what it thinks is the best format, but this doesn't always work perfectly. 

Most eReaders other than Kindle support multiple formats so you might not need to worry too much about format. You will want to convert your books from whatever format they are in to AZW3 format to get them to work on kindle devices however.

You can also download your ebooks from your eReader into Calibre by going to your device and selecting to send them to Calibre library. Great for making sure you still own your kindle books that were on your device. 

If you bought books from Kobo you will need to do a little searching for the DRM removal plugin for Calibre.

## That is All There is to It

This isn't extremely detailed for a tutorial, but this isn't that complicated either. I may edit the article with more details in the future, if anyone thinks it would be helpful. I feel it is important to remind people they don't need to throw out their eReader just because a bad actor decided to change the terms after the sale.

I'd also recommend that you send customer service tickets to Amazon complaining about your inability to download books you paid for anymore. You bought them when the ability to download them was a thing and now you can't anymore. You bought a product that worked one way and then they changed it on you after the sell.
