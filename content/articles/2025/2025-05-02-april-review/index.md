description: A lot has happened this month. Lets go over what has been going on in my world and share some fun links. 
---

I didn't spend as much time as I normally do online lately. This month was focused more on work, my relationship with my girlfriend, and hobbies outside of watching YouTube and reading blogs across the web. This was my splurge month and there was a lot of adventure, but that also means I'm not going to be spending much over the next few months as I try to recover my savings. I'll probably have way more links next month.

## Knott's Berry Farm Trip

The big highlight was going to the Knott's Berry Farm amusement park for their boysenberry festival to celebrate my girlfriend's birthday. Knott's is my favorite amusement of the few I've been to and I wanted to share that with my partner. It is like a combination of a traditional theme park, a flea market with local vendors, and an interactive museum. Many of the buildings in the western themed section of the park are historic buildings, they maintain a working steam engine that is used for a ride, and generally show a lot of respect for California's history and culture. They have sections dedicated to the [Peanuts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peanuts) comic strip and a few other areas that highlight California's history, but the most interesting and largest part of the park is the western themed section.

My girlfriend and I went on a few rides, watched a play, and explored the park. It was a truly special experience. 

Also, the food is fantastic for an amusement park so if you plan to visit make sure you try the boysenberry everything.

## New Camera

I've decided that this would be my splurge month and bought a camera. I've been saving up for years and finally dropped way too much money on a Sony a6700 and a Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 DC DN Contemporary Lens. The camera and the lens are both fantastic. I didn't have enough money for both a prime and a zoom, so I got this Sigma zoom for the most versatility. I've not done any real photography in years and was never that great at it, but I need more hobbies outside of sitting in front of my computer all day. 

The autofocus is fast, the camera shoots in 4k with slow/fast motion support, the subject detection is amazing, and it is fairly lightweight/small. The last digital camera I used was an old Nikon DSLR; it was heavy, subject detection was less than stellar, and generally it didn't spark joy. This Sony camera is wonderful though. Took it to a park and was able to get eye tracking working on flying birds, it even got a few shots in focus! 

I've not really gotten a chance to dive deep into the camera's settings or learn all its ins and outs yet, but even at the stock settings it does a great job in both manual and auto modes. I've mostly been shooting in Aperture Priority mode, but I am going to customize the buttons and what have you so I can more easily dive into shooting manual. Aperture Priority is probably all I need, but it is fun to really dive into the camera. That is the other thing I like about the camera, the menu system is fairly straight forward, but gives me a lot of control. This is the first time in a while that (relatively) new tech has trusted me enough to let me truly tinker with it.

I also considered Fuji and OM Systems, but I've had to configure Fuji x-ray software and hated it (not that it is relevant to their cameras) and the OM Systems micro 4/3rds camera I was looking at didn't seem to be all that more portable than the Sony and costs way more. Sony has a wide variety of first and third party lenses and the a6700 is popular enough to have extensive documentation and tutorials online so it felt the best choice overall.

It is another [tool that sparks joy](/articles/2024/tools-spark-joy/).

## Things I Learned

### Finding Boot Bottlenecks with systemd-analyze

`systemd-analyze` is a nifty little command I discovered that helps you discover how long it is taking for your system to boot and what tasks are taking up that time.

Pass the `blame` argument to the command, then you get a nice breakdown of all the tasks that are leading to the high boot time.

Shaved off more than a few seconds from my boot time thanks to this command. Might not sound like a lot, but it adds up when you use a computer each day.

## Games

I completely dropped *Atelier Yumia* after it completely crashed right after loading a save game twice. Might come back to it when it is patched up, but I judge a game based on how it released, not how they might fix it up. It is understandable that games might have a bug or crash every once in a while, but they should not be released when obvious issues are not worked out. I'm going to be sticking to *Atelier Sophie* till I'm done with it, then I might give the rest of the series some attention before trying *Yumia* again.

## Movies

I watched *Memoir of a Snail* with my girlfriend. It was a creative and soulful movie. It isn't a light movie as it deals with depression, suicide, religious cults, and child abuse, but I feel it tackled the themes with humor and respect. By the end of the story, the protagonist overcomes her despair through effort and willpower before things all fall into place. Many stories that try to do this kind of despair to triumph storyline do it in reverse, giving their protagonist good fortune that then turns around their despair. Memoir of a Snail tells a story of struggle and hope rather than one of just blind luck, it gives the protagonist far more respect and credit than most stories. The main character has people helping her and good fortune, but even they come into her life due to her being a good person and fighting the good fight. I won't say it is a perfect movie, but it is definitely worth a watch.

## Books

Robert Hickman wrote a [method book for playing the Ocarina](https://pureocarinas.com/ocarina-method-book). I've not gone through it completely yet, but I'm very interested in reading through it sometime in the future. It is free online, but you can order physical copies as well. It has been a while since I've played the ocarina, but I'm trying to get back into it. My muscle memory is still there, but I'm really rusty and can't read sheet music as well as I used to. In any case, so far it seems to have great advice. The book is free so take a look if you are interested in the instrument. 

I finished *We are Legion, We are Bob* and my opinion of it only grew more positive as the book went on. Leaving a book for a few months and then finishing the last half of it in a day is a bad habit of mine. Seriously, I finished reading the second half of the book in a day after not touching it for weeks. This book is fun, silly, and full of heart.

### Cool Projects

Thunderbird, the awesome FOSS email/calendar tool, announced that they are going to be providing their own email servers as well as extra features in the form of [Thundermail and Thunderbird Pro Services](https://blog.thunderbird.net/2025/04/thundermail-and-thunderbird-pro-services/). This is really cool assuming everything goes well. I've used Thunderbird for a very long time and thanks to a recent increase in funding they have taken the program to the next level. The UX has been made better (except for the hamburger menus, those should never exist on desktop), it has been very stable, and I have trust in their team to not do what the rest of Mozilla does. I'm looking forward to seeing what their services provide. Currently, I use the email servers provided by my web host, but I've been looking for an email provider that works with standard protocols (I'm not installing Proton's or Tuta's apps just to check my email) and is affordable.

The EFF released [Rayhunter, a tool to detect fake cellphone towers](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/03/meet-rayhunter-new-open-source-tool-eff-detect-cellular-spying?language=en). This tool is likely illegal in many places as law enforcement use these fake towers to spy on protests and track people. On a personal level I feel this is something that people should have when gathering together in protest.

[Drew DeVault](https://drewdevault.com) released a Firefox add-on called [Price Perspective](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/price-perspective/). It shows you how much something costs in relation the buying power of different people. It is depressing and emphasizes the difference between us and the richest people. Some people would not be able to buy a car in their lifetime while Zuckerberg makes enough to be able to afford that same car in less than a second. DeVault has a [blog post going over the project](https://drewdevault.com/2025/04/04/2025-04-04-Price-perspective.html) if you are interested.

[Linkhut](https://linkhut.org) is a bookmarking tool. If you want to share links across the Internet, but don't want to go through the work of setting up a website like I have here, this looks like an ideal tool. It has a clean UI, supports RSS, and is FOSS. I might play around with it in the future.

### Articles

Conduition goes over how he went about [Reverse Engineering TicketMaster's Rotating Barcodes](https://conduition.io/coding/ticketmaster/). TicketMaster is a horrible company that holds a monopoly on event tickets. They use TOTP as a DRM mechanism for said tickets. This causes all sorts of issues for end users, requiring an internet connection and smartphone to use them. I've never actually used TicketMaster, but my friends and the internet in general agree that it is a terrible company. Props to Conduition for reverse engineering the way it works. We need a world without DRM if consumers are to be free to own the things they buy, enjoy using technology, and be free.

This one is not an article, but a blog I would like to highlight. [David Revoy](https://www.davidrevoy.com) is a French digital artist that only uses FOSS software. He shares not only his artwork, but also reviews and setup guides on getting drawing tablets working on Linux. I've known about him and his [Pepper & Carrot](https://www.peppercarrot.com) web comic for years, but recently I was in the market for a drawing tablet for my girlfriend and his blog came in handy. His philosophy towards libre and open source culture is lovely in a world full of AI, engagement bate, intentional brain rot, and DRM. 

Dave Gauer wrote a strong article about the current [situation in tech and the billionaires who made tech hostile](https://ratfactor.com/tech-nope). There is a lot here; tech optimism and the sadness that most people don't interact with the beautiful side of tech, hope and fear for the future, and a strong call to action. Big tech doesn't represent Dave or many of those of us who work in tech, but the media likes to portray it as such. Not all tech is manipulative or profit motivated, but the masses usually don't see that. Most of us don't want to be profit motivated dictators. We need to unite and stand against evil wherever it may be found. One of the reasons I started blogging was to help people obtain freedom through technology, but commercial tech serves as a fetter many of them cannot remove. We need to fight directly against big tech and also create pathways for more people to engage with the good in tech so they may fight back as well. 

Michał Sapka talks about his [new static site generator](https://michal.sapka.pl/2025/msite/) for his new website. This is a cool project. I'm likely to stick with Hugo and Markdown for the time being, but the thought of building something myself has crossed my mind a few times. People who use Emacs seem to be able to live in Emacs for almost anything and when they can't, they create a way to make it so they can.

Nicole Tietz-Sokolskaya [explains endianness](https://ntietz.com/blog/endianness/?) in a way that is much more understandable than it has ever been explained to me. Very informative and at the same time she reminds us that living in the U.S. has become very scary for a lot of people.

Ava talks about the [scent she wants her blog to give off as well as the scents surrounding her life](https://blog.avas.space/scent/). I think it is a cute sentiment and one that I can get behind. I'm not a fan of strong scents either, preferring natural and subtle ones. My surroundings often smell like green or black tea, my shampoo smells like the woods in fall, my partner likes vanilla and lavender so sometimes it is in the air, and that is about it. We also have cats so we avoid oils and incents as they are usually toxic for the little critters. If we didn't have cats I'd probably have cedar, cinnamon, orange, and vanilla oils in a diffuser.

On the more technical note Ava talks about [hating talking with AI](https://blog.avas.space/prompts/). Fortunately management hasn't had any of the AI Kool-Aid yet at my company, but I know all too well how terrible AI chatbots are for anything beyond the most basic things. AI is a liability at best, and at worse it could be making us dumber by outsourcing critical thinking. Maybe that is why AI bros don't find any problems with it, they have already given up on thinking? Maybe that is a bit harsh, but the tech is currently doing more harm than good. AI bros and AI chatbots are both the most annoying people to work with, it isn't about not being a team player, it is about having a brain. 

Wouter Groeneveld talks about [the pain of decentralizing his phone and why it is important](https://brainbaking.com/post/2025/04/your-phone-should-be-distributed-not-centralized/). The pain is all too relatable. Been using a degoogled phone for 5 years now and stopped using my Google account for most things before that. Been trying to decentralize my phone; it is a lot easier when you can't use Google Play Services, but it is still a process. It takes a conscious effort, lots of personal research, and you have to be "that guy" who complains. Restaurants will try to use QR codes to save on cost, my bank app didn't work after an update and I had to complain for months before it worked again (fortunately they have a website), and so on. We need to push for a future where the people who couldn't be bothered with all that effort still benefit get privacy and security that we ourselves are struggling to obtain. 

Ruben talks about [how welcoming BSD and Linux are compared to Apple's and Microsoft's offerings](https://rubenerd.com/wait-you-dont-need-permission-to-run-linux/). On Windows and Mac you are constantly having to ask for permission to do things and many times the answer is no. You have little agency (less every update) to choose what you want to do with your computer, the software you probably paid too much for, and your data. I've not used BSD in any real capacity other than via TrueNAS Core, but I know on Linux I'm allowed to run the software I want, my way. I will get helpful suggestions that something is not advised or that it will break my system, but it will not stop me from doing it. Not everyone needs or wants that level of power, but at the same time everyone deserves to have control over the products they bought.

Robert Hickman talks about [audio puzzle design in video games](https://pureocarinas.com/approachable-audio-puzzles). Video games often communicate primarily through visuals and not audio, this makes most games and gamers ill-suited for audio puzzles. Hickman suggests that game designers should assume no prior musical skill from players and should also make audio puzzles a core part of gameplay if they are to exist in the game. This can help train the player's ability to hear different sounds and understand the audio puzzle far better. Nowadays, games have a common visual language that makes visual puzzles easier to conceptualize for the average gamer, but we don't have that in audio puzzles simply because there aren't that many and the ones that do exist are often isolated to a specific part of a game. This makes audio puzzles much more frustrating to an untrained ear.

### Videos

David Picciuto talks about [his book collection and the value of books](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=khL2R3Vz5p0). He brings up a great point about how reading from a physical book helps with retention and learning compared to just looking something up online. Reading a book is a deliberate act, scrolling online often is not. He also talks about the books that changed his life and how he approaches creativity. There is a lot of passion and value in this video.

Zach Freeman shared some [MTG 3D prints as well as a commander deck built around alliteration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GQNxkBwd1N4) as part of his April Fools' Day skit. Always fun to watch Zach's stuff and the deck's theme is great. It is really nice to see him including more of his hobbies into his channel. Due to how recommendation algorithms work, it is not easy for YouTube channels to cover a wide variety of topics, fortunately 3D printing and making things in general is broad enough that there is some wiggle room. 

Dr. Andrew Henry from Religion for Breakfast shares [Dr. Devin Pope's research on religious service attendance in the United States](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fgpms51vAcQ). The data is very interesting, but the method of obtaining it is the same as how advertisers, data brokers, and governments do. It is mildly concerning. Dr. Pope used cell phone location data to track the location of millions of Americans. This data is easily purchased so it isn't surprising, but a good reminder to use open source apps and location services from organizations you trust. It is also not surprising, but funny and interesting seeing how many people lie about going to Church. 

I generally avoid commentary and "skeptic" YouTube channels like this one, but I was made aware of this interesting video Drew from Genetically Modified Skeptic created on [how he avoided the alt-right/anti-woke pipeline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ID8Xq3chNi4). It is easy to dismiss people who complain about "wokeness" as idiots, but there is a reason for their underlying beliefs. Many are just angry at the world and try to find direction, leading them down a rage bate rabbit hole that leads to them finding more things to be angry about. Not saying that is an excuse for bigots, they are still horrible people, but horrible people often have experiences that lead them to being horrible people. I'm glad that someone on the skeptic/atheist media side avoided being drawn into the anti-SJW nonsense.  

Jeremy Fielding walks us through his [process for tearing down and reverse engineering things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXRSt3asv0w). He does this while he takes apart an industrial robot. Jeremy always has useful insights when it comes to engineering. It is very interesting to see how the industrial robot compares to the one he made himself.

Angelika talks about [game user interfaces](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL152bMdK0k), the different design philosophies and styles, and why overly minimalistic designs can harm player enjoyment. I agree with her that games with UI that fits the game world is preferable to the uninspired UI that many modern games go for nowadays. A good UI needs more than just a nice coat of paint though, it needs to be easy to navigate and legible. 

Patrick [tested out one of those AI "writing" tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB1snKUyEMY) and explains why AI writing is a scam. I feel sorry for him that he had to read through AI slop based on his idea. I'm not the first to say it, and it is not the first time I've written it, but AI is not capable of creating art and those who use generative AI are being lazy, dumb, and greedy. AI takes away agency, removes the work involved in the creative process, and there is no world someone creating without a profit motive would resort to such a tool. 

Genuine Curiosity talks about [relating to small moments in history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxwVuz365zk) using personal accounts, photos, and home videos. History is one of my favorite things to study, but (by necessity) it is almost always taught on a macro level in schools. It is good to know of Alexander the Great's exploits intellectually, but it is far more interesting to know [what he ate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdKVnrlhe-o&pp=0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv), the daily lives of his solders, and the lives of the people in the lands he conquered. Recent history was not very interesting to me back in school in comparison to things that happened centuries ago, but it should have been even more interesting due to the relevance of it. It wasn't till I started watching YouTube and reading more personal accounts that I got more interested in the history of the early 19th and 20th centuries. Look at the Internet Archive, learn your family history if you can, checkout some photo books from your local library. It is when we connect on a personal level that we truly start to understand the past.

## What a Month

It was a busy month, but a fun one. Tariffs and the current political climate in the United States are going to make it difficult to do anything like this again, but I want to try focusing on more fun experiences this year. 

There are a lot of things to do at home and now that I'm broke I have no way of avoiding them. The next few months will be focused on photography, enjoying the media I have here, and relaxing with my partner and cats.

Thank you for reading.

I will upload some photos I've taken soon so look forward to that.
