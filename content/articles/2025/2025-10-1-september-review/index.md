description: A lot has happened this month. Lets go over what has been going on in my world and share some fun links. 
---

It was a crazy month. This month was a bit of a reset for me. More focus on work and improving my home life. I did get a new UPS backup for my home server/networking cabinet, went to another farmers market out here, and celebrated my sister's birthday, and generally had a decent month.

Did a little tinkering in RPG Maker MZ and have been considering posting some small posts regarding it. The engine is not open source and has a lot of small issues, but the limitations really do give my tinkering spirit joy. I made a faction reputation tracker menu and a simplistic base building system. 

I haven't uploaded any photos this month, but rest assured I am still taking them. Not had much time to go over them though. 

Most of you are probably tired of hearing about US politics, so I commented out my rant about the current situation in the United States (you can still read it on the git repo for the blog). I do share a few political leaning posts though in the links (sorry, it is impossible to escape).

## Things I Learned

Rubber, the plant/substance, is apparently [named after the erasers that were made from it](https://www.etymonline.com/word/rubber). 

<!-- ## US News

### Racial Profiling

The corrupt supreme court in the United States [legalized racial profiling this month](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/08/us/politics/supreme-court-immigration-racial-profiling.html). I'm afraid for my partner, friends, and everyone not white. Though even being white ins't really the shield people think it is, but that is something for a future discussion. When ICE "detains" people it often involves being held at gun point and hulled somewhere you don't know till they decide if they want to believe you are a US citizen or not. This is evil and anyone who defends this really needs to spend some time thinking about what and who they were.

### Kirk

I have a lot of thoughts about this and I'm still gathering them, but here is where I am:

The right wing agitator Charlie Kirk was murdered this month. This is a person who tried to get trans people killed, spread conspiracy theories, and was overall a terrible human being. He went to colleges to monetize outrage, he antagonized the marginalized and cozzied up with bigots, and he took advantage of the religious. Kirk's legacy is one of hate, but he did not directly commit violence and violence against him was not the answer. 

While I don't think you can have a good faith argument with someone who thinks you shouldn't exist, especially when they make money off of it (like Kirk and all these debate bros do), but that is why we have a public forum. Sure, Kirk and his contemporaries were working on removing the ability to speak out against them, but we still have the ability to do so at the moment. We should use it to shame these horrible people, not make them a martyr. Kirk was a small fry that made money telling people he didn't like that they didn't deserve to exist, now his death is being used to justify his beliefs to people who have the power to act on them. Ending his life emboldened the true fascists and now we are going to see the fallout of it. 

Kirk didn't deserve to die, he deserved to live in mediocrity, mocked for his bigotry. I'm not saying we should appease those who do us harm, but we (that is people who hold that everyone should have equal rights, that policing speech is wrong, and other generally socially left leaning views) need to fight smartly. Unfortunately public opinion is easily swayed and those who are fed a steady diet of conspiracy theories are ever eager to latch onto news that paints the left (or really anyone who thinks we should have decent health care and access to housing) as violent. Unfortunately this puts us in a dangerous position.  -->

### Cool Projects

CodapopKSP's [Library of Time](https://libraryoftime.xyz) is an amazing collection of calendars, time formats, and astronomical data. You can compare the Julian Calendar to Unix time and the Coptic calendar all at once. Each entry has a short blurb about it and tells you about how accurate it is. There are links to sources for each calendar so you can check the work. The code for the project is on github, but I do not see any license at the moment so it is only source available as far as I can tell. If you have ever been interested in time this might be a valuable resource.

### Articles

Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò wrote about why [we need to shame bigots, the importance of basic decency, and why you can't entertain those with ideas that are incompatible with said basic decency and respect](https://www.bostonreview.net/articles/how-can-we-live-together/). For the most part I agree with this sentiment. Don't get me wrong, I think self-censorship and the over zealousness of the early 2010s social justice movement is bad and is partially responsible for pushing people to extreme ideologies. I do think that we do need to reflect more on our own personal beliefs, why we hold them, and if they might be harmful though. People like Kirk, Shapiro, and Trump are all allowed to hold their views as long as they don't act on them, but the moment they step out of their caves and spit out hate we have the obligation to mock them. Bigots can be bigots, but they should be embraced to speak their shameful slop. I'm not for policing speech, but if someone is advocating for harm to others (as Kirk and Trump both have done) they should know they are not welcome in polite company. This also goes back to what I've been saying about debate bros (on both sides of the spectrum); they do not come to a debate in good faith, to find the truth, or to understand the other side. They come with the goal of attacking their opponent, preferably someone unprepared like a college student, and use the moment to validate and push hateful rhetoric. Why would I want to spend time arguing with someone who thinks I shouldn't be with my girlfriend because we are a different race or wants me dead because I think housing should not be an investment class? In any case, go read Olúfẹ́mi O. Táíwò's post, it is a good read that covers much of why things are falling apart. It essentially boils down to, right wing speakers do not observe basic civility or decency when in public. 

Like all corporate controlled software, Bitnami did a rug pull on their customers and users. FastCode [wrote an article about it](https://fastcode.io/2025/08/30/the-69-billion-domino-effect-how-vmwares-debt-fueled-acquisition-is-killing-open-source-one-repository-at-a-time/) that I discovered thanks to Ruben Schade's [post on the subject](https://rubenerd.com/fastcode-on-open-source-software-shakedowns/). Basically a big company did the only logical thing and burned all good will in the name of *number go up*. As long as we live in a system that incentives greed and we don't build alternatives (something hard to do without money, a resource that non-greedy people find hard to come by) we will see companies continue to abuse everyone. Every day we get pushed further and further into the corner by capitalistic greed. Moving to another platform won't fix the problem if it is not run by a community founded in good faith. Paying these big companies the ransom they are charging will likely be the only option for many. 

Dan Q abused the QR code standards to make [a functioning QR code that doubles as a maze](https://danq.me/2025/08/22/ms-paint-grade-qr-codes/) that looks like it was drawn up in MS Paint. All the error correction and redundancy in QR codes gives a lot of flexibility when you want to do stuff like this. In the real world this redundancy is important, but in digital space you don't need to worry about the code getting damaged or light being off so much that it can't be scanned. I'm a sucker for stuff like this.

Chris Coyier [has some comments and shares some other people's comments on the US government's new design initiative](https://chriscoyier.net/2025/09/02/12693/). Trump and his goons destroyed a lot of government digital infrastructure and fired the people who built it. Now Trump is acting like he is the good guy with an executive order to re-built it in his own image. What is terrifying about the current regime's *America by Design* plan is the implications of what they see as American. Expect propaganda, expect it to be poorly constructed, expect it to not serve the people.  

Dave Rupert muses on an interview he listened to that [touched on why someone would start a website](https://daverupert.com/2025/09/why-would-anybody-start-a-website/). The conclusion in that interview was depressingly capitalist focused, tech bros and business people cannot imagine a world where anyone would do something without financial incentive. Fortunately Dave isn't fully buying into that and neither is most of the indie web. Making money is often nice (even I have a donation page with dreams of making this site self-sufficient), but there are many other reasons to own and run a website. Most of it boils down to having personal freedom and control over what you consume and create, but I'm sure there are many other reasons as well that don't have to do with "number go up".

David from Forking Mad [vented about LinkedIn](https://forkingmad.blog/whats-the-point-of-linkedin/) and asked an important question, have any of us gotten anything positive out of LinkedIn. The only time I've ever heard anything positive about that website was from people who drank the endless growth death cult kool-aid. The site markets itself as a easy way to network and share your resume, but it is mostly just a data collection tool for Microsoft and other scams that also lets people post unhinged pro-capitalist dystopian propaganda. 

Frills has been feeling some [burnout with her website rebuild](https://frills.dev/blog/2025/september/indie-web-burnout/). The good news is that the indieweb is a hobby and not an obligation. While I do think that sometimes we just need to grind out our projects when motivation drops, it is also important to remember to not sacrifice our joy for something just to complete it. The profit driven society we live in tries to convince us that all effort must go into completing something even if it no longer gives us joy, but that is not true. Hope Frills comes back to publishing things on her blog and continues developing it of course, but only when she is ready.

Tadaima talks about [an anime that didn't age well and now that they are older, they see a lot of the problems with it](https://tadaima.bearblog.dev/anime-does-not-age-well/). One major problem with Japanese media in the west is the difference in sensibilities. Not saying that all the questionable stuff going on in anime or videogames is okay in its home country or that cultural norms haven't changed over years, but as a westerner you will almost always find something wrong in a large amount of anime that isn't targeted specifically at young kids. As kids we often don't notice the things that violate our own social norms, we don't have a fully developed understanding of morality, and nostalgia blocks out the bits we didn't like once we've grown up. Anime is particularly full of tropes that have a strong ick to them that you either learn to live with to enjoy good stories or you decide to stop consuming it all together. The other point Tadaima brings up is that when you are young it is easier to ignore plot holes and assume things are deep. I really need to re-watch Evangelion again to see if it is as good as teenage me thought it was.

### Videos

Emily made a [poison cabinet book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Keo_U1cpwP4). This is a wonderful project I've always wanted to do, but never had the heart to destroy a nice book. Maybe one day I'll find some books worth carving up to make something like this. In any case, it is nice seeing someone who isn't a professional model maker showing their work. Really awesome. 

Michael Burns (former host of WiseCrack) talks about [the challenges and benefits of teaching and engaging in philosophy on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zd2Ivvn8DTg). I absolutely love philosophy and firmly believe that every person benefits being able to access and learn the subject. YouTube is a platform that is inherently antithetical to philosophy and that makes it hard to do videos on the subject without some form of intellectual dishonesty. For better and for worse YouTube is the most accessible platform for video creation and consumption so these philosophers and teacher on the platform have to balance running a business, appeasing an algorithm that promotes less mindful videos, and dealing with the nature of social media (social media is inherently anti-nuance). For all its shortcoming though, YouTube is likely going to be one of the most vital sources of education in the United States considering how the current administration has started attacking anything they disagree with or call woke (philosophy and deeper thinking in general).

Shameless Nerd talks about the [importance of hobbies, how most of us can find time for them, and how generative AI is the result of capitalism's inability to understand effort for its own sake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5jBawWAL50). There is a lot in the video, but it all boils down to: find time for having fun, don't overthink the process, and don't think you need to be good at something to start doing it.

f3mi talks about the [Korg M01 emulators for DS and 3DS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ptN-3RT8yA) and then exports the MIDI tracks made in the 3DS version the music can be edited on a computer or played on a MIDI boombox. She also put a bout a bounty to have someone make a tool that extracts the MIDI tracks from the DS version of the emulator as that version had no way to export tracks to an SD card. [A person did end up making the tool and released it on github](https://github.com/gabem-p/hamkorger). I have no real musical talent (I can play clarinet and ocarina somewhat decently), but this is very interesting. The idea that there were tools released for the DS and even the 3DS is amazing. Nowadays, almost everyone has a smartphone so these cool programs running on game consoles are very rare.  

flurples made his own [case and mechanical keyboard for a Framework laptop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGHAUogFsYY). For those of you who do not know, Framework makes modular laptops that are supposed to be easy to repair and upgrade. This modularity has made them very popular x86 platforms for people to build their own projects when ARM and RISK-V aren't suitable. I've always wanted a laptop with a mechanical keyboard, but nowadays, I mostly am at home and don't need a laptop for my computing. If my current laptop (that is collecting dust) ever bites the bullet framework will be high on my potential laptops list. 

Joel from 3D Printing Nerd did a [little interview and showcase of Make Good's 3D printed accessibility tools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ZssfJKI9Y). One of the greatest goods to come out of the availability of free design tools and accessible manufacturing is the creation of accessibility tools for the disabled. Make Good provides 3D printed devices to help people with disabilities and even offers their 3D models for free as open source designs. Seeing as the current government in the United States is waging war against accessibility (DEI) we need non-profits to fill the gaps. Check out Make Good's [website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ZssfJKI9Y) too.

The history of Christianity in the Arab world is very interesting and often sad. Persecution is a part of life and yet, they are physically and culturally closer to the root of the religion than most other Christians. Dr. Andrew M. Henry from Religion for Breakfast [covers the history, challenges, and beliefs of Coptic Christians](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5EnGR1XqmU). Well worth a watch if you are curious about Egyptian and Christian history and culture.  

Steven Bennett published another dev log for his [DIY version of the Dyson Solar Cycle, the Open Task Light](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqRkz75jfIk). It is really awesome to see this project come together over the course of years. The first video was done 3 years ago and now it is almost complete. What is really exciting to hear is he is planning to sell kits for the Open Task Light. Might be worth building in the future.

## To Another Month

October is going to be a month of creativity and making. Not sure if I will have more blog posts as a result, but my goal is to work on a creative project every day this month. 

Today's creative project was finishing this post. 

I've got a few projects that I've been putting off and it has been fairly depressing times lately so it is as good a time as any to start working through some productive distractions.

I've had a lot of wonderful teas lately so I might do a few tea reviews or slap together that tea database I've talked about.
