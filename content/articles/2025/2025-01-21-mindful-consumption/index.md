description: Being mindful about consumption is important. With that in mind I'm going to start a No Buy year challenge.
---

With prices likely to skyrocket in the U.S. due to upcoming tariffs and most products being garbage anyway I figured this year will be one where I try to cut back on spending. That is not to say I won't buy anything or even forgo every luxury, but I want to be more mindful about what I spend my money on this year.

## What is a No Buy

No buy is basically a budgeting method where you focus on only buying necessities and using what you already own. You set rules about what you will or won't buy rather than budgeting within spending brackets (though you can add a traditional budget on top).

There is a lot to find about the concept by searching for it online or at a library, but the core of it is to limit needless consumption and be mindful of your own spending.

A low buy year is like a no buy year, but a lot more liberal about what a person is allowed to buy. As a maximalist I probably would fail a No Buy completely if it was too strict.

## Why do this?

I like to think I'm fairly good at not spending too much money on things I don't need, but last year I ordered out way too often and bought way too many games I've not even played. This year I have a couple large purchases I want to make, a large savings goal, and the new administration has goals that are likely to make life a lot harder for most of us in the United States.

I was also inspired by the enshitification of almost everything. I love tech, gadgets, and what have you, but I don't want to buy internet connected e-waste backed by VC and private equity. Seeing the way the market alienates us, destroys our planet, and doesn't even give us anything in return leaves a sour taste in my mouth.

Ultimately though it is about being more mindful about what I consume and where my money is going.

## The plan

I am not a lifestyle blogger or a productivity bro so I won't go into extreme detail about my plan this year, but I'll list a few things in case you are interested in trying this yourself or want to shame me when I end up buying something I shouldn't.

### To buy

There are quite a few things that I do need to buy this year, some are rather obvious:

- Food, hygiene items, cat food, and other grocery and sundry items.
- Rent and Internet bill
- Healthcare (if I can afford it)
- Laundry cleaning. I rent and have no laundry hookup. The laundry machine eats quarters though so I might consider doing more washing by hand.
- Learning Opportunities (classes and experiences over stuff)

### Not to Buy

- Ordering food out. This has been my largest expense last year and my wallet and physical health have not been too pleased about it. It is very easy to be lazy and not cook, but I need to put an end to meal delivery all together and limit eating out to dates and hangouts with friends.
-  Video Games. I have a few exceptions for the year, but I am going to limit my video game purchases this year. I have over 100 Switch games sitting on my shelf and many PC games from GOG as well. I plan to focus on playing the ones I have rather than collecting more.
- Anything from a company that has a record of changing the terms of the sale on the customer with little way of opting out. Companies like Bamboo Labs, Amazon, Roku, Samsung, Cricut (the cutting plotter), and many more make products that could make the lives of people better, but have shown active hostility towards their customers by altering the product after the sale with updates and proprietary software.
- Fun Homelab equipment I don't need. I really want to get a 2.5Gb managed switch and a small application server setup, but I don't really need them. I might put this on the maybe pile if I find a situation where it is justified.
- Proprietary software. I've been burned on Plex, I knew I shouldn't have gotten it, but I spent good money on it and then Plex constantly does things that do not serve their customers. The promises of proprietary software are often snake oil. 
- Books. Along side unplayed video games is a shelf full of unread books. I'll go to the library if I really want to read something I don't have.
- More notebooks. I have enough, I know I have enough, for some reason I still get more.
- Tools before I need them. I am a maximalist and love being prepared, but that is how I waste money on things that I don't need.
- Any gift over $50. I love giving people gifts, but I way over spent last year.
- Magic the Gathering products. Hasbro has been trying their best to milk the game for all its worth and I'm tired of it. I love the game and will continue to play, but I'm likely not to buy anything more, it is a money sink. I hardly got anything in this category last year so it should be easy. 

### Big Purchases

There are a few things this year that I absolutely want to get, but aren't necessary for my life. If I have enough savings and do not end up buying anything I don't need I'll probably get these things.

- Prusa CORE One printer. Unlike some 3D printer companies, Prusa has been a friend to open source and builds quality products. I have a Mark 3S+ printer that has been chugging along without much maintenance for a few years now. My dad is building a maker space at my parent's home so I was thinking of selling/donating it to him and getting myself a CORE One as it better suits living in an apartment with cats. That does depend on the reviews though. 
- A Sony a6700 or similar crop sensor camera. I want to get into video and photography again and this camera checks all the boxes from what I can see. Sony has a standard lense mount across its lineup, a healthy 3rd party ecosystem, and their camera division is probably the least evil part of Sony as a company.
- Maybe the Switch 2, depending on reviews. It is going to be backwards compatible with Switch games and if it gives a marked improvement over the base model I'll consider getting it as I want to get more into the games I own.

### Exceptions

There are a few things that I will buy as I need them. Probably as things break.

- If my Pixel 3a breaks I'll get a new one. I've had this phone since May of 2020. I've tried taking good care of it, I use a 3rd party OS that was actively maintained up till last year for security updates, and overall it just works. The power button is finicky, the battery is starting to show its age, the OS I use no longer maintains support for the old phone, and the USB C port at the bottom doesn't work very well so I replaced it with one of those cheep wireless charging adapters. The phone is on its last leg, but I hate to throw it away just because phone companies think you should upgrade every few years.
- There are a few high priority switch games I want to get next year that I am considering buying.
- I'll buy books that I need as study material for any classes/work/new hobbies.
- When I start a project I will buy the tools needed if I lack them. This will hopefully keep my habit of getting everything I don't need ahead of time in check.
- A few quality clothing items. Usually this is on people's no buy list, but I generally buy two or three items per year at most. Some of my shirts and pants are starting to fall apart. Some of my clothes are over 6 years old at this point. Already ordered some socks and pants, probably won't need anything else this year.
- Tea. I am going to keep buying tea this year as long as tariffs and climate change don't make it prohibitively expensive. 

### Other Considerations

I love the idea of library and circular economies (something I'm sure the more capitalist minded among you would hate). With that in mind I'm going to try buying things used, borrow things from others, and loan out things I have when possible over buying new things. It is better for everyone involved.

I will still be going on dates with my girlfriend, but will try packing lunch and go for experiences over shopping.

There are a lot of other things to consider, but I won't go over them here.

## I do with Less Consumption

Just like last year where I was trying to be more mindful of my media diet this year I'm going to be more mindful overall with my spending and diet. I plan to write out a more detailed plan for a low buy year in my journal, but thought it would be fun to share.

What are your plans for the new year? You can always send me an email.
