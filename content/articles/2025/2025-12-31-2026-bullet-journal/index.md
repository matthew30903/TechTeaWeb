Happy New Year!

So at the start of this year I started using a single notebook to keep track of my journalling, random thoughts, and anything else I needed to write down. This was loosely based on the Bullet Journal Method created by Ryder Carroll. The Bullet Journal was designed for people who are much busier than myself (i.e. people who think they need a planner), but I liked some of the concepts and rolled with it. For the first time I've written something down almost every day in a year. While nothing impressive, it has helped me a lot with my memory.

## The Philosophy Behind my Notebook

As I said before, I'm not that busy of a person. I don't manage people, I work from home, and don't have hundreds of personal projects that I'm trying to turn into products. That makes planners and things like them (future and monthly logs in Bullet Journalling) less useful for me. What I do need however is a way to track what I've done for future reference. Fortunately paper is flexible and lets you do whatever you want with it. 

I love Personal Information/Knowledge Management (PIM/PKM) stuff. I also love having accessible logs of where I've been, what I did last Sunday, etc. Most of this is probably not useful, but it might be and more importantly I'm the kind of sick person who enjoys tracking these things.

With that in mind I've come up with a basic layout for my 2026 Journal that should help facilitate the tracking, a small bit of planning when needed, and help me log what happened on the days going forward.

## The Sections of the Notebook

My notebook is still going to be laid out like a bullet journal. I have an Index to keep track of different sections, a future log for major events though most of those can be put in a digital calendar, a monthly log to keep track of major events that happened to me (mostly the weekend dates I have with my partner), a habit tracker (something I started doing a few months ago and it really helps me see what I've been up to), and the daily logs. I will also do general note-taking and simple project management in this book.

The index and future log are self-explanatory, but I'll share the other sections.

### Monthly Log and Habit Tracker

{{< figure src="./img/montly_log_habit_tracker" alt="Image: Montly log and habit tracker">}}

Very basic. I have the month's name and a simple list of days going down the side of the left page. I track a few things on here ahead of time like birthdays and when I'm on-call for work. Otherwise, I go through my daily log and take out a highlight of the day if there was one. My journal for 2025 had many blank days on the monthly log as I only really filled out the days that I did something major or to see at a glance where I went with my partner on a weekend. This year I'll try logging a little more, try to find something most days worth mentioning.

On the right side is a simple habit tracker. I write what time I wake up and track things I want to do or want to do less of during a month. You turn the notebook sideways and the days of the month are on the top (forgot to write them down here) and then on the left side you will see the individual entries. I put a dot in the field for a completed task and leave blank if I didn't do it. I also have been putting an X in the column if I did something that I didn't want to do, like eating fast food. The simplicity of this system allows me to expand it or change it up during the month or month to month.

The things I've tracked ever since starting this system have been: if I read (this is almost always a yes and more of an easy win to make me feel better), if I went for a walk (also usually a yes, but less so than reading and something I want to do more actively in 2026), consuming food from restaurants/prepared food (something I want to stop doing so much), and if I created something (something I started tracking in October). I will add or remove things as they pertain to my current situation, but these have been staples. I also use the free space alongside the habit tracker to write down notes or things I've done that I want to highlight like completing a book.

As the year starts today I really need to complete this section.

### Daily Log.

This is the most important bit, I use the bullet journal method's rapid logging system to capture events, feelings, and other things that happen during the day. 

While this is the simplest thing, just a list of things, it is the core of everything else. I've discovered I'm not great at todo lists, but do sometimes put important tasks in the daily log to check off.

I always start this section with the date in Day of the Week, Month, Day of the Month format. Usually starts with when I wake up, if I slept past the alarm or woke up multiple times over the night, and how I am generally feeling in the morning. I also usually log how busy work was and any major things that happened, if I got a package, if I wrote an article and what it is about, anything related to my partner or cats, if I played a game or completed a book I've been reading, and general ideas that pop into my head. 

## A Second Notebook

The main journal is just that, a personal journal of what I did and my thoughts in a given moment. I decided to also get a second notebook/repurpose an old one to be a scratch pad and a consumption log.

I've been thinking of tracking in more detail the movies, books, and other media I consume. Do things like little book reports inside the notebook. We will see how that goes.

## Tools

I've been using an A5 Leuchtturm1917 hard cover notebook for a my journals for a long time. This year is no different. The paper is nice quality for the price, there are a lot of small details that make it easy to use (page numbers, pre-printed index, etc.), and is fountain pen friendly. I have it in a leather notebook cover I've had for a few years now. 

My primary pen is still the Pilot Custom 74. It feels nice to use and is one of the most luxurious things I own. It really motivates me to write each day. 

I also got a Pilot HI-TEC-C Coleto 5 in one multi-pen so I can add some color to my notebook. Last year the colors in my notebook only changed when I changed fountain pen ink. This year I'll be splashing in some color with this nice multi-pen. Is is thin for a multi-pen, the ink flows pretty good, and most importantly I am more willing to carry it with me than 5 seperate colored pens. Nothing wrong with going monochrome, but I feel like having a little color will help make things more playful.

## What is your System?

My life is not crazy enough to need anything complex, but I don't have the best memory so this system is meant to help me remember what goes on during a given day as well as work out my thoughts as they come.

Some people don't need any system and others have a complex planner. Let me know what you use if you do for PKM/PIM, journalling, and planning.
