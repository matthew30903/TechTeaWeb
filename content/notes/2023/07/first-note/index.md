description: Notes are short posts that don't warrant long form content.
---

We are going to try something new here. Normally I write long form content, hence the Articles section of this website. I've dabbled  in shot posts before, but WordPress was too cumbersome to really use for short form content. Now that we are using Hugo I'm going to give it a shot.

So what are Notes and why are they separate from the main website? I will be sharing things I find across the net here as well as quick tech tips and thoughts I have. This will be separate from the main blog to keep it from getting cluttered. Normally I save interesting articles and what have you in a note taking app, but now I can make it easier to share things with everyone here. Might even syndicate this over to the [fediverse](https://techtea.io/articles/2021/mastodon-gateway-to-the-fediverse/) one day.

In short, this will be like a microblog. Hope you look forward to seeing what I come up with.
