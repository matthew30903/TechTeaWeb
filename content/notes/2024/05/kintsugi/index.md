Kintsugi is the art of repairing broken pottery by mending broken parts with urushi lacquer dusted with with powdered precious metals. The whole philosophy behind kintsugi and wabi-sabi is something that many can benefit from, but today I just wanted to share my first attempt at it:

One of our cats broke their food dish a while back and I thought I may as well try fixing it instead of throwing it out. I personally believe we should try to fix things that are broken and kintsugi is a beautiful way to do so.

I got a small kit that uses two part epoxy resin and some goldish colored powder instead of the real deal, maybe if I get in the pottery repair business I can start getting fancy. A word of cation: do not do this for anything you are going to eat warm food off of, most epoxy resins are not food safe and even the ones that are are not usually good with high temperatures. Use the real stuff if you are going to use your pottery for food.

The cats also broke a glass lamp shade I want to fix using the same technique so I needed to get some practice in. I'll share it when it is done. Cats are a real handful, but I absolutely love them.
