description: I added a bookmarks section to the website.

In an era of AI generated garbage and AI curation we need human curation. Google's and Microsoft's AI generated summaries are not going to help you find good content, nor is Arc Search or ChatGPT. With search engines dying and these AI scams everywhere it falls onto individuals to share cool and amazing things just like in the early days of the internet. I started my [monthly favorites](/tags/monthly-favorites/) to help curate some of the things I consume and have been thinking about doing a link blog for a while.

With that in mind I finally started a new section on my website called [bookmarks](/bookmarks). These are links to other websites that include my comments about whatever the subject is. This way I can comment on more websites without blowing up the other parts of my website, share quality links my readers would otherwise not discover, and I can easily search for things I might want to reference in the future.

I hope this section is useful to some of you and if not you can safely ignore it. I also plan to add a blogroll in the not too distant future.
