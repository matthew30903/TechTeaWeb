description: My partner and I went to Descanso Gardens for the first time back in November.  
---

Descanso Gardens is a large 150-acre botanical garden near Los Angeles. My partner and I went back in November and I took over 500 photos. The amount taken was a bit intimidating, it took a while to pick out the ones I wanted to upload. I haven't edited these because if I did, they would never get uploaded. I need to be more impulsive this year about uploading things, even if they are far from perfect.

The place is beautiful and full of life, highly recommend going if you are in the area. We didn't see everything, but I don't really think it is doable in one day. There is a lot there and it is easy to get lost the moment you go off on a random trail instead of following the main path. 

These photos are all shot with a Sony A6700 and the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 DC DN Contemporary Lens with a Tiffen Fog 2 Filter. 

Let me know if you want the full resolution photos, I still have them. I downsized everything using ImageMagick to keep the site light and fast.
