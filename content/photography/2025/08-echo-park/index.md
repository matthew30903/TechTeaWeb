Went on a walk around Echo Park in Los Angeles, CA this month with a friend. While there, I took quite a bit of photos. Here are a few of them. I'm particularly fond of the photos of the ducks.

These photos are all shot with a Sony A6700 and the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 DC DN Contemporary Lens with a Tiffen Fog 2 Filter. I did light processing in Darktable and think I've got the basics down enough to get decent results.

This month I shot almost all my photos with the Tiffen Fog 2 filter on my lens. It is awesome and gives the photos a somewhat dreamy look. I might stick with it for a while.
