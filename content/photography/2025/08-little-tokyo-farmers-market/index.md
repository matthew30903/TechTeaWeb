description: Took some photos of the first Little Tokyo Farmer's Market. 
---

Little Tokyo in Los Angeles, CA is one of my partner and I's favorite places in the city. They just had their first farmer's market so we had to go.

They had a taiko drum performance, tea vendors, potters, street food, and of course farm fresh produce. It was a lot of fun, but it quickly got up to 90° F (32° C) so we left by noon.

These photos are all shot with a Sony A6700 and the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 DC DN Contemporary Lens with a Tiffen Fog 2 Filter. I did light processing in Darktable.

Let me know if you want the full resolution photos, I still have them. I downsized everything using ImageMagick to keep the site light and fast.
