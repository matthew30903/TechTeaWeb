description: Took more photos over these months. Here are the ones worth sharing.
---

I mostly shot some photos of my cats, Dara and Saoirse, and some flowers. I also took a lot of photos of my girlfriend and friends, but they didn't want their images shared across the internet. 

I was still learning the basics with the camera. These were the best. There are some other photos that look good in my folders, but I am still learning how to process RAWs and I only shot those ones in RAW. Once I get my RAW workflow down I'll upload them as well. The flowers were RAWs that I was able to edit alright. I have a bunch from a trip to Little Tokyo, but not many good ones so they will stay on my hard drive.

These photos are all shot with a Sony A6700 and the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 DC DN Contemporary Lens.
