description: Took some photos of a firestation. 
---

I took these photos while in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles with a friend, [same trip as in this set of photos](/photography/2025/august-echo-park/). The firefighters were very nice and let me take pictures. I'm not overly proud of these, but thought they could make a nice set. It looked like the firefighters were doing some maintenance on their equipment.

These photos are all shot with a Sony A6700 and the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 DC DN Contemporary Lens with a Tiffen Fog 2 Filter. I did light processing in Darktable.

Let me know if you want the full resolution photos, I still have them. I downsized everything using ImageMagick to keep the site light and fast.
