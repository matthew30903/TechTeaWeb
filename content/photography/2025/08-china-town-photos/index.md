description: Took some photos from my first time in Chinatown, LA.
---

I've been in LA for years now, but never went to Chinatown. Back in July a friend and I finally explored a little bit of the Chinatown area out here in Los Angeles.

I did a little RAW editing this time. Mostly just lens correction, exposure compensation, and cropping, but I'm starting to get the hang of it.

These photos are all shot with a Sony A6700 and the Sigma 18-50mm f/2.8 DC DN Contemporary Lens.
