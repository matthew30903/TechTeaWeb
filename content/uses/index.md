description: I use a lot of software and hardware in my daily life. This page was inspired by many other blogs.

I use a lot of things to get my days done. Maybe you will find something interesting that will help you out as well.

## Hardware

### Workstation: ASUSE ROG Strix GL704GW

This device has served me well for many years. It currently is running EndeavourOS and does what is needed for my personal tasks. I would rather have a desktop at this point, but when I got it I did not have room for one. The flaws with this machine are the battery life, though that is an issue with all "gaming" computers. It is a stationary laptop that weighs too much to take with me anywhere and the battery will die if it is unplugged when I turn it on. It will be replaced soon though.

### Desk: 72" x 30" V2 C-Frame desk from Uplift Desk

This desk is awesome. It is a sit/stand desk that has greatly helped me improve my posture and encourages me to walk around while I work. It only takes seconds to go from sitting to standing.

I got one with a dark bamboo top and the frame is black to match the rest of my equipment. I cannot emphasize enough how much of an improvement a large sit/stand desk is for my mental health. It is a small thing, but really contributed to making my workspace a nice place to be. I highly recommend getting at least the legs from Uplift and either sourcing your own desktop if you are handy or just buy one from them like I did.

Uplift offers a 15 year warranty and their products often go on sell. The desktops are a little pricy for what you are getting, but I think it is still worth it as they come with all the holes pre-drilled for you and use threaded inserts to make it easer to disassemble and reassemble later.

Before this I was using an Ikea Micke desk. It was not adjustable, small, took up way more floor space due to the included cabinet, and was all around unpleasant to use. It was only $100 at the time, but even back then that was a lot of money for me. The desk is also made out of particleboard, always unpleasant to deal with.

### 3d Printer: Original Prusa i3 MK3

I need to write an article about 3d printers in general, but they are amazing tools. I first had an Ender 3 clone, but it was not the best printer around. Now the Prusa is my main printer and it is a reliable workhorse. I'd recommend it if you want a quality printer that has good support from the manufacturer. Some might say they are overpriced and behind the innovations of the current market, but none of those other printer companies have the commitment to Open Source, Quality control, and support that Prusa has.

### Keyboard: ZSA Moonlander

This is an amazing keyboard, but the price made me hesitate for a while. This is a fully programmable split keyboard that has more features than I'll probably ever need, but I whole hearted recommend this keyboard as it saved me from a lot of pain. Before I was using this keyboard I was using the built in one in my laptop and started developing RSI. The pain got bad enough that I was having trouble sleeping. After using the split keyboard for a few months my pain started to disappear, fast forward a few years and I'm still using the keyboard today.

The thumb clusters are a bit fragile though and I did have one break on me when a cat sat on it. Fortunately ZSA's customer service is great and I was sent a replacement rather quickly. I am planning to write a full review one day.

## Software

### Desktop Operating System: EndeavourOS

I've jumped through many operating systems and settled on the almost Arch Linux EndeavourOS. This OS is basically Arch, but with a graphical installer, a friendly community, and some basic utilities to make running Arch a bit easier.

I love the access to the AUR, ease of tinkering, and the fast updates. The main thing that kept me from using Arch for so long was the upfront time commitment to get everything configured. EndeavourOS takes away a lot of that. It is still not as plug-in-play as most other Linux distros, but it strikes a good balance and encourages learning without being inaccessible. 

I'd recommend it to more experienced computer users who want something that mostly just works and are okay with tinkering from time to time. Otherwise I'd recommend Fedora, Debian, or PopOS.

### Desktop Environment: KDE Plasma

I've always liked KDE's approach to software: "Simple by default, Powerful when needed". KDE is the most customizable desktop environment while being accessible. There are many more customizable window managers out there and many more simplified desktops environments, but none of them reach the great middle ground Plasma has.

KDE integrates well with my Nextcloud server, email provider, and phone. It has many powerful tools that improve my productivity (KDE connect, widgets, Dolphin, etc) and it looks good while doing it.

KDE Has always been useful for me.

### Productivity Suite: NextCloud

NextCloud has completely replaced my need for things like Google or Dropbox. It might sound like a big claim, but it integrates into everything I use, gives me tools to backup my work, and allows me to easily share that work with others.

At the core I use NextCloud to sync my calendar, contacts, todo lists, and files between my phone and my desktop applications. I have both my KDE PIM and Thunderbird synced to it so my calendar for example shows up in the KDE calendar widget and my email program. You can even use it as a provider for large attachments in Thunderbird.

### Other software

TrueNAS Core: This is my main home server and NAS. It provides everything I need for the most part and I can spin up docker inside of a VM if I need more. I host my NextCloud server directly from a BSD Jail and have not had any problems with it.

VSCodium: This is the fully open source binary of VSCode. It has all the features and none of the Microsoft spyware. It is an awesome text editor for my use case with good integrations and plugin support when you need it.

GIMP: To think I used to use Photoshop (ew, I should probably write an article on why I hate Adobe with such passion). GIMP is what I use when I need to modify or make images. The only thing GIMP doesn't do is CMYK color and they are supposedly working on that. Once that is done there shouldn't be much other than education hold people back from escaping Adobe's claws.

Kdenlive: My video editor of choice. It is open source, stable, and generally enough for what I need. I used to use Adobe Premier (ew again) and after that I started using CyberLink PowerDirector as it was more stable and faster than Adobe's offerings. PowerDirector served me for years and then one day I switched to Linux full time and Kdenlive became stable enough to use for daily use. It is not perfect, but it is as good as it gets when it comes to open source video editors. It also is more stable than Premier. If you need professional grade software and don't care about open source as much I'd say use DaVinci Resolve.

What do you use? Is there any software I should try out? Please let me know via email or webmention.
