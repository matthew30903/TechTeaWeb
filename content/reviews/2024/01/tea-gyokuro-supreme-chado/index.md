## Thoughts

This particular gyokuro is not the highest quality and needs to be brewed at a far higher temperature than most I've had to get a good flavor. Once you bring the temprature up though it is a decent tea. The flavor could have been effected by the age of the tea or some other factor rather than the quality of the tea itself. For all I know it was sitting on the shelf for a few years before I came along.

The Chado Tea Room brews their teas a little too hot causing them to be bitter so I recommend getting the leaves from them rather than ordering a fresh pot from them in person.

For the price I'd say go with a different brand.

Score: 7/10, still good, but I'd say go for something else.

## My Brewing Method

Tempüå°Ô∏è: 58-63¬∞C  
Brew Time‚è±Ô∏è: 1 minute

I filled a warm cup about half way with freshly heated water and then submerged the leaves in a tea basket. Then filled the cup the rest of the way, lightly poring over the leaves as I filled the cup. When brewing green teas I often avoid poring water directly over the leaves or only lightly pore water over them and focus on the sides of the cup or tea bowl. Using my standard 53¬∞C temperature didn't produce a distinct flavor and brewing at the recommended temperature made the tea too bitter. A little experimentation goes a long way with this tea.

## Where can I get it?

You can get it from the [Chado's website](https://www.chadotea.com/products/gyokuro-supreme/) or visit their tea room in person. The tea is usually cheaper in person.
