## Thoughts

This is my first Hatsutsumi tea. It is a fukamushicha so it is steamed longer than many other green teas, giving it a rich and deep flavor. It is not bitter at all and has a faint sweetness to it.

This has been my daily tea since I obtained it and has been great, but finding more here in LA has not been easy. I am about to run out. In any case, I highly recommend it. If you can get a hold of some give it a try.

Score: 10/10, I loved it.

## My Brewing Method

I filled a warm cup about half way with freshly heated water and then submerged the leaves in a tea basket. Then filled the cup the rest of the way, lightly poring over the leaves as I filled the cup. 

I brewed using 70°C water and steeped for 1 minute. I didn't detect any major flavor differences between brewing 45 seconds or one minute, but going over does damage the flavor of the tea.

This tea can be steeped twice before I could detect any negative flavor changes, making it a great value.

## Where can I get it?

I obtained it from Tea Masters in the Little Tokyo district of Los Angeles, CA. I found the company's [website](https://www.hoshitea.com/shop/products/detail/21101) and it is far cheaper at 1,620 yen ($10.57 USD), but their website is only available in Japanese and that doesn't include shipping.
