## Thoughts

A solid black tea. I did not have a chance to try it gongfu style as I did not have much to test with. Brewing in a western style produced a strong, but not very astringent tea. This made it very easy to drink.

I'm not as big on black teas as I am on oolongs and greens, but every once in a while it is nice to have something a little more bitter. Maybe my pallet is not very refined, but this tea tastes basically like what you would expect a black tea to taste like.

Another note, this tea is organic and fair trade for what those labels are worth.

Score: 7/10, I like it.

## My Brewing Method

I filled a warm cup about half way with freshly heated water and then submerged the leaves in a tea basket. Then filled the cup the rest of the way, lightly poring over the leaves as I filled the cup. 

I brewed using boiling water and steeped for 3 minutes.

## Where can I get it?

You can get it from the [Davidson's website](https://www.davidsonstea.com/Yunnan_Black_Loose_Leaf.aspx/).
