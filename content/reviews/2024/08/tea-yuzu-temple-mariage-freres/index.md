## Thoughts

A good green tea, but not the greatest I've ever had. Tastes like a sencha with citrus. You can see the yuzu flakes in the tea. Some flavored teas use artificial flavorings or just smell to trick your brain into perceiving the flavor. This one has real citrus flavor. The packaging has no brewing instructions and the ingredients only listed "tea and fragrance", not very descriptive nor does it inspire confidence considering the price. The website lists brewing instructions that lead to a bitter cup so the above are my recommendations for starting temperatures when experimenting with green teas.

Score: 7/10, I like it quite a bit. It is a bit on the pricy side buying it locally, but is a lot cheaper if ordered online from Mariage Frères website so I'll give it an extra point.

## My Brewing Method

I filled a warm cup about half way with freshly heated water and then submerged the leaves in a tea basket. Then filled the cup the rest of the way, lightly poring around the leaves as I filled the cup. 

I brewed using 80°C water for 2 to 3 minutes. Mariage Frères' website recommends 95°C for 3 minutes, but that makes for a more bitter cup than I'd like. You can definitely experiment with the temperature and brewing time to get the most flavor out of it.

## Where can I get it?

I obtained it from Monsieur Marcel Gourmet Market in Los Angeles, CA. They are a french themed market that sells tea, french made goods, wine, and coffee at a steep markup. I'd only recommend buying from there if you are looking in person for new teas. 

You can get it for half the price I paid at the time of this writing at  Mariage Frères' website. It is not worth the markup, but at €15.60/100g it is a decent tea for the price.
