## Thoughts

This tea was a delightful mix of mint, lemongrass, orange peels, chamomile, and tea. The quality is decent and all flavors are present without overpowering one another. Not a whole lot to say other than that it is a wonderful tea that I recommend. That said I have a weakness for mint and chamomile flavors.

Score: 7/10

## My Brewing Method

Temp🌡️: 90 °C  
Brew Time⏱️: 3 minute

I filled a warm cup about half way with freshly heated water and then submerged the tea bag into the water. Then I filled the cup the rest of the way. I occasionally moved the tea bag as it brewed to help spread the flavor.

## Where can I get it?

You may be able to find it in a local store that teas as Vahdam is a popular brand, but if you cannot you can also get it from the [manufacturers website](https://www.vahdam.com/products/chamomile-mint-citrus-green-tea?variant=13111073472555). Sipsby gave me the tea in pyramid tea bags, but it is also available in the form of loose leaf.
