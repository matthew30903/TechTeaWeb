## Thoughts

Oolong's are a very diverse type of tea and I will say this tea is like no other. It has a soft, but distinct flavor closer to a light black tea than a lot of other oolongs I've had. It is earthy and nutty flavor with a hint of sweetness.

My favorite thing about this tea is how smooth it is to drink, I could drink this every day. Unfortunately getting this specific tea might not be possible due to how Renegade runs their business, more on that in a moment.

Score: 9/10 or Love it

## My Brewing Method

Tempüå°Ô∏è: 80¬∞ C  
Brew Time‚è±Ô∏è: 3 minute

I filled a warm cup about half way with freshly heated water and then submerged the leaves in a tea basket. Then filled the cup the rest of the way, lightly poring over the leaves as I filled the cup. With this tea I was able to experiment with the amount of tea to water without issue as it is a very forgiving tea. 

It tasted best as described above, but it also works alright gongfu style. I brewed around 90¬∞ C for 15 seconds and added 5 seconds each brew. It tasted best after the first brew and started to decline rapidly. 

## Where can I get it?

It is currently out of stock, but [sipsby](https://www.sipsby.com/products/renegade-tea-estate-lazy-morning) might have some available in the future or you can find it at Renegade's [website](https://www.renegadetea.com).

Renegade is not a normal tea store so only sell a few teas in their store as samplers. Instead you can purchase tea from a plot of land they own. Instead of buying pre-processed tea from them, you rent a tea garden from them for a growing season and tell them how you want the tea processed. Once the season is over they will send you the tea via mail. I've not tried it yet and a year is a long time to have money tied up, but the quality of this tea proves that they know their stuff. One day I'll try this out and write a review of it.
